These files have been somewhat updated so that they at least format
without fatal errors under FreeBSD 2.0-current (and so presumably 2.1).
Some parts are not very accurate, and quite a bit of extra verbiage
should probably be added describing FreeBSD additions relative to 4.4.
The formatting is not perfect, and groff generates copious errors which
hopefully some [nt]roff expert will actually look into some day.  The entire
suite needs to be fixed to learn to live with obj directories, in line
with our goal to have a completely read-only source tree, before it can
be added to the top-level Makefile (if it is even then).

The man[1-8] files were generated through the following process:
	locate *.1
	pipe through a long series of fgrep and sed commands to fix up
	sort-regexp ^.*/\([^/]*\)$ \1 in Emacs
	visually inspect the result for duplicates and false matches
