.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm build
.Nd information on how to build the system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The source for the
.Fx
system and applications are contained in three different directories,
normally
.Pa /usr/src ,
.Pa /usr/doc ,
and
.Pa /usr/ports .
.Pa /usr/src
contains the
.Dq "base system"
sources, which is loosely defined as the things required to rebuild
the system to a useful state.
.Pa /usr/doc
contains the source for the system documentation, excluding the manual
pages.
.Pa /usr/ports
is a tree that provides a consistent interface for building and
installing third party applications.
.Pp
The
.Xr make 1
command is used in each of these directories to build and install the
things in that directory. Issuing the make command in any directory or
subdirectory of those directories has the same effect as issuing the
same command in all subdirectories of that directory. With no target
specified, the things in that directory are just built. The following
list provides the names and actions for other targets:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar clean
Removes any files created during the build process.
.It Ar install
Installs the results of the build for this directory.
.It Ar update
Gets updated sources as configured in
.Pa /etc/make.conf .
.El
.Pp
The other
.Pa /usr/src
make targets are:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar buildworld
Rebuild everything but the kernel, configure files in
.Pa /etc ,
and release.
.It Ar installworld
Install everything built by
.Dq buildworld .
.It Ar world
buildworld + installworld.
.It Ar buildkernel
Rebuild the kernel and the kernel-modules.
.It Ar installkernel
Install the kernel and the kernel-modules.
.It Ar reinstallkernel
Reinstall the kernel and the kernel-modules.
.It Ar upgrade
Upgrade a.out (2.2.x/3.0) system to the new ELF way
.It Ar most
Build user commands, no libraries or include files.
.It Ar installmost
Install user commands, no libraries or include files.
.It Ar aout-to-elf
Upgrade an system from a.out to elf format.
.It Ar aout-to-elf-build
Build everything required to upgrade a system from a.out to elf format.
.It Ar aout-to-elf-install
Install everything built by aout-to-elf-build.
.It Ar move-aout-libs
Move the a.out libraries into an aout sub-directory of each elf
library sub-directory.
.El
.Pp
For more information about the ports build process, see
.Xr ports 7 .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ".Va TARGET_ARCH"
.It Va TARGET_ARCH
The target machine processor architecture.
This is analogous to the
.Dq "uname -p"
output.
Set this to cross-build for a different architecture.
.It Va TARGET
The target hardware platform.
This is analogous to the
.Dq "uname -m"
output.
This is necessary to cross-build some target architectures.
For example, cross-building for PC98 machines requires
.Va "TARGET_ARCH=i386"
and
.Va "TARGET=pc98" .
.It Va NO_WERROR
If defined, warnings will not cause the build to halt, even if the
makefile says otherwise.
.It Va DESTDIR
The directory hierarchy where the resulting binaries will be
installed.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /usr/share/examples/etc/make.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/make.conf
.It Pa /usr/doc/Makefile
.It Pa /usr/doc/share/mk/doc.project.mk
.It Pa /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk
.It Pa /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.sites.mk
.It Pa /usr/share/examples/etc//make.conf
.It Pa /usr/src/Makefile
.It Pa /usr/src/Makefile.inc1
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The
.Dq approved
method of updating your system from the latest sources is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
make buildworld
make buildkernel KERNCONF=FOO
make installkernel KERNCONF=FOO
make installworld
mergemaster
.Ed
.Pp
.Dq FOO
must be replaced with the name of the kernel configuration file from which
the kernel should be built.
Alternatively, the
.Va KERNCONF
variable in
.Pa /etc/make.conf
can be set to the name of the kernel to build;
in this case the
.Dq KERNCONF=FOO
part of the
.Dq buildkernel
and
.Dq installkernel
commands can be omitted.
.Pp
After running these commands a system reboot is required,
otherwise many programs which have been rebuilt
(such as
.Nm ps ,
.Nm top ,
etc)
may not work with the old kernel which is still running.
.Pp
The following sequence of commands can be used to cross-build the
system for the Alpha architecture on an i386 host:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/src
make TARGET_ARCH=alpha buildworld
make TARGET_ARCH=alpha DESTDIR=/clients/axp installworld
