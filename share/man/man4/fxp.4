.Sh NAME
.Nm fxp
.Nd Intel EtherExpress Pro/100B ethernet device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device fxp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the EtherExpress Pro/10, InBusiness
10/100, Pro/100 B, Pro/100+, Pro/100 VE, Pro/100 M, and Pro/100 S
PCI Fast Ethernet adapters based on the Intel i82557, i82558, i82559,
i82550, or i82562 Ethernet chips.
Many on-board network interfaces on Intel motherboards use these chips
and are also supported.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (fast ethernet) operation
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Set full duplex operation
.El
.Pp
Note that 100baseTX media type is not available on the Pro/10.
For further information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports a special link option:
.Bl -tag -width link0
.It Cm link0
Some chip revisions have loadable microcode which can be used to reduce the
interrupt load on the host cpu.
Not all boards have microcode support.
Setting the
.Cm link0
flag with
.Xr ifconfig 8
will download the microcode to the chip if it is available.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "fxp%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "fxp%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "fxp%d: Failed to malloc memory"
There are not enough mbuf's available for allocation.
.It "fxp%d: device timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "fxp%d: Microcode loaded, int_delay: %d usec  bundle_max: %d"
The chip has successfully downloaded the microcode, and changed the
parameterized values to the given settings.
