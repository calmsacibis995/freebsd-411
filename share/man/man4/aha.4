.Sh NAME
.Nm aha
.Nd Adaptec SCSI host adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device "aha0 at isa? port ? irq ? drq 5"
.Cd device scbus0 at aha0
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to the
.Tn SCSI
bus connected to an Adaptec 1510, 152x, 1535, 154xA, 154xB, 154xC,
154xCF, 154xCP, or 164x host adapter.
Host adapters supporting a 154x compatible interface,
such as some Tekram controllers and the Adaptec 174x in 154x
emulation mode can also be attached with this driver.
For optimum
performance, Adaptec 174x controllers should be configured in
enhanced mode and attached via the
.Xr ahb 4
driver.
.Pp
One kernel config entry for every card to be attached by the system is
required.
Specific values for the port address, irq, and drq may be
specified.
If wildcard values are used, the driver will query the
device for its current settings and use those.
If the port address
is a wildcard, the driver consults an internal table of possible port address
locations and attaches to the first unattached card it finds.
The possible
port addresses for this card are 0x330, 0x334, 0x230, 0x234, 0x130, and
0x134.
