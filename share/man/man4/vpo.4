.Sh NAME
.Nm vpo
.Nd parallel to SCSI interface driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device vpo"
.Pp
For one or more SCSI busses:
.Cd "device scbus0 at vpo0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The primary purpose of the
.Nm
driver is to provide access to the Adaptec AIC-7110 SCSI controller built
in the Iomega ZIP drive.
But it should also work with the Iomega Jaz Traveller
parallel to SCSI interface.
.Pp
The driver has been extended to the ZIP+ drive which is based on the
Iomega Matchmaker Parallel to SCSI interface.
.Sh USAGE
The driver should let you use a printer connected to the drive while
transfering data.
.Pp
DOS and
.Fx
filesystems are supported.
When mounting a DOS filesystem or
formating a
.Fx
filesystem, check the slice of the disk with the
.Xr fdisk 8
utility.
.Pp
In order to unixify a ZIP disk, put the following in /etc/disktab:
.Bd -literal
zip|zip 100:\\
        :ty=removable:se#512:nc#96:nt#64:ns#32:\\
        :pa#196608:oa#0:ba#4096:fa#512:\\
        :pb#196608:ob#0:bb#4096:fb#512:\\
        :pc#196608:oc#0:bc#4096:fc#512:
.Ed
.Pp
and use
.Xr disklabel 8 .
.Pp
If you have trouble with your driver, your parallel chipset may not run
properly at the detected mode (NIBBLE, PS2 or EPP). Tune the
.Xr ppc 4
bootflags to force other modes.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr da 4 ,
.Xr lpt 4 ,
.Xr ppbus 4 ,
.Xr ppc 4 ,
.Xr scsi 4
.Sh BUGS
During boot, the driver first tries to detect a classic ZIP, then a ZIP+.
The ZIP+ detection is intrusive and may send errorneous charaters to your
printer if the drive is not connected to your parallel port.
