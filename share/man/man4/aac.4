.Sh NAME
.Nm aac
.Nd Adaptec AdvancedRAID Controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options AAC_COMPAT_LINUX
.Cd options AAC_DEBUG=N
.Cd device pci
.Cd device aac
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Adaptec AAC family SATA, SCSI Ultra2
and Ultra160 RAID controllers.
These controllers support RAID 0, 1, 5, 10, and volume sets.
They have four channels in the add-in version
or 1-2 channels in the motherboard integrated version,
and are most often found relabeled by Dell or Hewlett-Packard.
Supported controllers include:
.Bl -bullet

Access to RAID containers is available via the
.Pa /dev/aacd?
device nodes.
Individual drives cannot be accessed
unless they are part of a container or volume set,
and non-fixed disks cannot be accessed.
Containers can be configured by using
either the on-board BIOS utility of the card,
or a Linux-based management application.
.Pp
The
.Pa /dev/aac?
device nodes provide access to the management interface of the controller.
One node exists per installed card.
The aliases
.Pa /dev/afa?
and
.Pa /dev/hpn?
exist for the Dell and HP flavors, respectively, and are required for
the CLI management utility available from these vendors to work.
Compiling the driver with the
.Dv AAC_COMPAT_LINUX
option enables the Linux-compatible
.Xr ioctl 2
interface for the management device.
.Ss Tuning
The read-only sysctl
.Va hw.aac.iosize_max
defaults to 65536 and may be set at boot time to another value via
.Xr loader 8 .
This value determines the maximum data transfer size allowed
to/from an array.
Setting it higher will result in better performance,
especially for large sequential access patterns.
.Em Beware :
internal limitations
of the card limit this value to 64K for arrays with many members.
While it may be safe to raise this value, this is done
.Em at the operator's own risk .
Note also that
performance peaks at a value of 96K,
and drops off dramatically at 128K,
due to other limitations of the card.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Compiling with
.Dv AAC_DEBUG
set to a number between 0 and 3
will enable increasingly verbose debug messages.
.Pp
The adapter can send status and alert messages asynchronously
to the driver.
These messages are printed on the system console,
and are also queued for retrieval by a management application.

.Sh BUGS
This driver is not compatible with controllers that have version 1.x firmware.
The firmware version is the same as the kernel version printed in the BIOS
POST and driver attach messages.
.Pp
This driver will not work on systems with more than 4GB of memory.
.Pp
The controller is not actually paused on suspend/resume.
.Pp
Unloading driver is not supported at this time.
