.Sh NAME
.Nm fwe
.Nd Ethernet emulation driver for FireWire
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "kldload firewire"
.Cd "kldload if_fwe"
.Pp
or
.Pp
.Cd "device firewire"
.Cd "device fwe"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides non-standard Ethernet emulation over FireWire (IEEE 1394).
.Pp
.Xr firewire 4
and
.Xr fwohci 4
must be configured in the kernel as well.
.Pp
This driver exploits asynchronous stream over IEEE 1394 to carry Ethernet
frames.
The stream channel can be specified by
the
.Va hw.firewire.fwe.stream_ch
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.Pp
This driver supports
.Xr polling 4
as well if it is compiled with the
.Dv DEVICE_POLLING
option.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh BUGS
This driver emulates Ethernet in a very adhoc way and it does not reserve a
stream channel using an isochronous manager.
Note that this driver uses a protocol which is very different from RFC 2734
(IPv4 over IEEE 1394).
