.Sh DESCRIPTION
/dev/snp? are snoop devices which allow users to attach to any tty
and watch activities on it.
The kernel must be compiled with
.Cd "device snp" ,
or the
.Nm
device must be loaded,
for these devices to be available.
.Pp
To associate a given
.Nm
device with a tty to be observed, open the
.Nm
device and then use the SNPSTTY ioctl.
The argument passed to the ioctl is the address of a variable of type
dev_t.
To detach the snp device from a tty use a pointer to a value of (dev_t)-1.
.Pp
The SNPGTTY ioctl returns information about the current tty attached to
the open
.Nm
device.
.Pp
The FIONREAD ioctl returns a positive value equal to the number of characters
in a read buffer.
Special values defined are:
.Bl -tag -width SNP_TTYCLOSE
.It Dv SNP_OFLOW

.It Dv SNP_TTYCLOSE
tty not attached.
.It Dv SNP_DETACH
