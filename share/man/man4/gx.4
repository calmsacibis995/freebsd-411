.Sh NAME
.Nm gx
.Nd "Intel Pro/1000 gigabit ethernet driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device gx"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for NICs based on the Intel 82542 and 82543
gigabit ethernet controller chips.
Both fiber and copper variants of
the cards are supported.
.Pp
The 82542 supports TBI (ten bit interface), while the 82543 supports the
GMII transceivers, which means it can be used with either copper or
1000baseX fiber applications.
Both boards support VLAN tagging/insertion and the 82543 additionally
supports TCP/IP checksum offload.
.Pp
The 82543-T cards use the Marvell 10/100/1000 copper gigabit transceiver
chip, which supports autonegotiation of 10, 100 and 1000Mbps modes in
full or half duplex, however half duplex 1000Mbps is not supported.
.Pp
The driver also supports jumbo frames, which can be configured
via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo frames.
Using jumbo frames can greatly improve performance for certain tasks,
such as file transfers and data streaming.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
User can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8 Ns 's
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (fast ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8 Ns 's
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseTX
Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.
Only
.Cm full-duplex
mode is supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm full-duplex"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports one special link option for 1000baseTX cards:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm link0"
.It Cm link0
With 1000baseTX cards, establishing a link between two ports requires
that one port be configured as a master and the other a slave.
With autonegotiation,
the master/slave settings should be chosen automatically.
Setting the
.Cm link0
flag with
.Xr ifconfig 8
will force the link up instead.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "gx%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "gx%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "gx%d: couldn't setup irq"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "gx%d: failed to read station address"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "gx%d: no memory for list buffers!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for per-device instance information
during initialization.
.It "gx%d: failed to enable memory mapping!"
The driver failed to initialize PCI shared memory mapping.
This might happen if the card is not in a bus-master slot.
.It "gx%d: GMII/MII, PHY not detected"
The MII probe routines failed to detect the PHY.
This might happen if miibus is not configured.
.It "gx%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "gx%d: mbuf allocation failed -- packet dropped"
The driver could not allocate a mbuf for the receive ring.
.It "gx%d: cluster allocation failed -- packet dropped"
The driver could not allocate a mbuf cluster for the receive ring.
.It "gx%d: link down"
The link status changed from up to down.
.It "gx%d: link up"
The link status changed from down to up.
