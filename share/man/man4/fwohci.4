.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
device driver was written by
.An Katsushi Kobayashi
and
.An Hidetoshi Shimokawa .
.Sh BUGS
The driver allows physical access from any nodes on the bus by default.
This means that any devices on the bus can read and modify any memory space
which can be accessed by an IEEE 1394 OHCI chip.
It is allowed mostly for
.Xr sbp 4
devices.
This should be changed to allow it only for specific devices.
Anyway, FireWire is a bus and not expected to be connected with
un-trustable devices because a node can monitor all the traffic.
