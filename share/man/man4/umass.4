.Sh NAME
.Nm umass
.Nd USB Mass Storage Devices driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device umass"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Mass Storage devices that attach to the USB
port.
Supported are:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
IBM 256MB USB Drive(MSYSTEM DiskOnKey2)
.It
Iomega USB Zip 100 drive
.It
Iomega USB Zip 250 drive

.It
Panasonic KXL-CB35AN(DVD-ROM & CD-R/RW)
.It
Trek Thumbdrive 8MB
.It
VAIO floppy drive (includes Y-E Data Flashbuster-U)
.El
.Pp
The driver also supports some USB adapters for removable media.
Among the supported models are:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
PNY Attache Flash Drive
.It
SanDisk SDDR-31 (Compact Flash)
.It
SanDisk SDDR-75 (only Compact Flash port works)

.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
Asahi Optical (PENTAX) Optio 230 & 330
.El
.Pp
.Nm usb
and one of
.Nm uhci
or
.Nm ohci
must be configured in the kernel as well.
Last but not least, support for
SCSI drives,
.Nm da .
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
device umass
device scbus
device da
device pass
.Ed
.Pp
Add the
.Nm
driver to the kernel.
.Pp
.Dl "camcontrol rescan 0"
.Pp
Rescan a Zip drive that was added after boot.
The command above
assumes that the Zip drive is on the first SCSI bus in the system.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
camcontrol rescan 0:0:0
camcontrol rescan 0:0:1
camcontrol rescan 0:0:2
camcontrol rescan 0:0:3
.Ed
.Pp
Rescan all slots on a multi-slot flash reader, where the slots map to separate
LUNs on a single SCSI ID.
Typically only the first slot will be enabled at boot time.
Again, this assumes that the flash reader is the first SCSI bus in the system.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bsdlabel -w da0 zip100
newfs da0c
mount -t ufs /dev/da0c /mnt
.Ed
.Pp
Write a disklabel to the Zip drive (see
.Nm vpo
for the
.Nm disktab
entry), creates the file system and mounts the new file system on /mnt.
.Pp
.Dl "newfs_msdos /dev/da0"
.Pp
Create a new FAT type file system.
Care should be taken not to run
.Xr newfs 8
on devices that already contain data, as this will result in the
information being lost.
.Pp
Many consumer devices such as digital cameras automatically create
.Tn MS-DOS
based file systems when storing information such as images and
videos.
These file systems can be accessed by specifying the file system
type as
.Nm msdos
when using
.Xr mount 8 .
