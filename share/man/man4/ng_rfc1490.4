.Sh NAME
.Nm ng_rfc1490
.Nd RFC 1490 netgraph node type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In netgraph/ng_rfc1490.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm rfc1490
node type performs protocol encapsulation, de-encapsulation, and
multiplexing according to RFC 1490 (which has since been updated by RFC 2427).
This particular type of encapsulation is often used on top of frame relay
DLCI channels.
.Pp
The
.Dv downstream
hook is used to transmit and receive encapsulated frames. On the other
side of the node, the
.Dv inet
and
.Dv ppp
hooks are used to transmit and receive raw IP frames and PPP frames,
respectively. PPP frames are transmitted and received according to
RFC 1973; in particular, frames appearing on the
.Dv ppp
hook begin with the PPP protocol number.
.Pp
Typically the
.Dv inet
hook is connected to the
.Dv inet
hook of an
.Xr ng_iface 4
node.
.Sh HOOKS
This node type supports the following hooks:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width foobarbazum
.It Dv downstream
Connects to the RFC 1490 peer entity.
.It Dv inet
Transmits and receives raw IP frames.
.It Dv ppp
Transmits and receives PPP frames.
.El
.Sh CONTROL MESSAGES
This node type only supports the generic control messages.
.Sh SHUTDOWN
This node shuts down upon receipt of a
.Dv NGM_SHUTDOWN
control message, or when all hooks have been disconnected.
.Sh BUGS
Not all of RFC 1490 is implemented.
