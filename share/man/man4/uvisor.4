.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

driver provides support for the Handspring Visor, a Palmpilot compatible PDA.
.Pp
The device is accessed through the
.Xr ucom 4
driver which makes it behave like a
.Xr tty 4 .
The device has several ports for different purposes, each of them gets its
own
.Xr ucom 4
device.
The attach message describes the purpose of each port.
.Pp
The usual Pilot tools can be used to access the Visor on the HotSync port.
.Sh BUGS
The code to provide multiple
.Xr ucom 4
instances has not yet been ported from
.Nx .
It is unclear whether this driver works in its
current state.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr ucom 4 ,
.Xr usb 4
