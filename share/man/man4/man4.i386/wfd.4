.Sh NAME
.Nm wfd
.Nd ATAPI floppy driver (LS-120 floppy driver)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options ATAPI
.Cd options ATAPI_STATIC
.Cd device wfd
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for
.Em ATAPI
floppy disks, typically LS-120 style 120mb/1.4mb floppy drives.
In general the interfaces are similar to those described by
.Xr wd 4 .
.Pp
As the IDE controllers are probed during boot, the
.Em IDE
buses are scanned for devices.
Any devices found which answered as
.Sq Em Floppy
and
.Sq Em removable
type device will be attached to the
.Nm
driver.
The first device found will be attached as
.Em wfd0
and the next,
.Em wfd1 ,
and so on.
.Pp
When used with a LS-120 drive, this driver will read/write the following
types of floppy disk:
.Bl -tag -width 1.25MB -compact
.It 120mb
.It 1.44mb
.It 1.25mb (PC-9801 series format)
.It 1.2mb
.It 720kb
.El
.Sh PARTITIONING
The
.Nm
driver allows the disk to have two levels of partitioning.
One layer, called the
.Dq slice layer ,
is used to separate the
.Fx
areas of the disk from areas used by other operating systems.
The second layer is the native
.Bx 4.4
partitioning scheme,
.Xr disklabel 5 ,
which is used to subdivide the
.Fx
slices into areas for individual filesystems.
For more information, see
.Xr fdisk 8
and
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
respectively.
.Pp
If an uninitialized disk is opened, the slice table will be
initialized with a fictitious
.Fx
slice spanning the entire disk.  Similarly, if an uninitialized
(or
.No non- Ns Fx )
slice is opened, its disklabel will be initialized with parameters
returned by the drive and a single
.Sq Li c
partition encompassing the entire slice.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Making LS-120/ZIP disks can be a bit more complicated than usual depending
upon whether or not you chose to use the slice code or not.
LS-120 floppies are typically considered floppy devices and do not carry
a slice table.  On the other hand, Zip disks, which use the same driver,
are considered hard disks by the vendor, so for compatibility, you should
use a slice table.
.Pp
The driver will handle either type of disk with or without a slice
table,  but for compatibility, you should generally create disks
that follow the vendor's behavior.
.Pp
To create a UFS LS-120 disk (no slice table),
First, make sure there is no slice table on the disk):
.Dl # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/wfd0 count=16
.Pp
Next, disklabel the disk:
.Dl # disklabel -rw wfd0 fd120m
.Pp
Then newfs as usual:
.Dl # newfs /dev/rwfd0a
.Pp
To create a standard 1.44mb floppy in a LS-120 drive, do the same
procedure, but use
.Ar fd1440
as the disk layout when using the
.Nm disklabel
command.
.Sh KERNEL CONFIGURATION
Only one
.Nm
device is necessary in the config file; data structures are dynamically
allocated as disks are found on the
.Tn IDE
buses.
.Sh NOTES
This driver is attached to the
.Xr wdc 4
IDE/ATAPI disk controller driver.  It will not work unless
IDE controllers have been configured and enabled in the kernel.
.Sh BUGS
Floppy formatting is not yet supported.
.Pp
This driver is still a beta version.
If you have problems, please report them to
.Aq bugs@FreeBSD.org
and the author.
