.Sh NAME
.Nm ie
.Nd ethernet device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device ie0 at isa? port 0x360 irq 7 iomem 0xd0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for 8 and 16bit ISA ethernet cards that are based on
the Intel i82586 chip.
It supports the AT&T Starlan 10 and Starlan Fiber,
the EN100, the Intel EtherExpress 16, the 3COM 3C507 and the RACAL Interlan
NI5210.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ie%d: unknown board type code %d"
An i82586 chip was found, but the driver was unable to determine the actual
board type during the probe.
.It "ie%d: kernel configured maddr %x doesn't match board configured maddr %x"
The device probe detected a different maddr than the one specified in the
kernel configuration file.
.It "ie%d: can't find shared memory"
The device probe could not access the shared memory to determine its size.
.It "ie%d: kernel configured msize %d doesn't match board configured msize %d"
The device probe found a different size for the shared memory than the one
specified in the kernel configuration file.
.It "ie%d: kernel configured irq %d doesn't match board configured irq %d"
The device probe detected that the board is configured for a different
interrupt than the one specified in the kernel configuration file.
.It "ie%d: reset"
The Intel i82586 had to be reset by the driver.
.It "ie%d: transceiver problem"
The driver has detected a problem with the ethernet transceiver.
This is
usually due to a loose or broken transceiver cable when using an external
transceiver.
When you experience this problem with an on-card transceiver
your card may be incorrectly jumpered for to use an external transceiver.
Worst case your on-board transceiver may be broken.
.It "ie%d: TDR detected an open %d clocks away"
The driver detected an open circuit in the ethernet cable.
Check your
coax cable and terminator resistors.
.It "ie%d: TDR detected a short %d clocks away"
The driver detected a short circuit in the ethernet cable.
Check your
coax cable and terminator resistors.
.It "ie%d: TDR returned unknown status %x"
The driver got an unknown status from the card during the ethernet cable
test.
.It "ie%d: multicast address setup command failed"
The card could not be put into multicast mode.
.It "ie%d: configure command failed"
The card refused to respond correctly during configuration.
.It "ie%d: individual address setup command failed"
The programming of the Ethernet (MAC) address failed.
.El
.Sh CAVEATS
The Racal Interlan NI5210 comes in variants with 8 and 16 kbytes of
shared memory.
It is strongly advisable to use the 16 kbyte variant.
You can upgrade your 8 kbyte card to 16 kbyte by adding an additional
RAM chip.
