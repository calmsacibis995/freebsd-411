.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver covers the SoundBlaster family of cards including the
SoundBlaster 1.0 to the SoundBlaster 16/SoundBlaster 32.  The awe driver
provides AWE32/64 functionality.  This driver is provided in
.Fx
versions 2.0-current through 3.0-current.
.Sh BUGS
Since the SB16 uses the same IRQ and addresses for
the different drivers, some of the snd drivers will not be probed because
the kernel thinks there is a conflict.
.Pp
Current version doesn't support mode changes without closing and reopening
the device.
Support for this feature may be implemented in a future
version of this driver.
