.Sh NAME
.Nm ep
.Nd Ethernet driver for 3Com Etherlink III (3c5x9)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device ep"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports network adapters based on the 3Com 3C5x9 Etherlink III
chipset, like the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
3C509 ISA
.It
3C529 MCA
.It
3C579 EISA
.It
3CXE589EC, 3CXE589ET PCMCIA
.It
3C589/589B/589C/589D/589E/574TX/574B PC Card/PCMCIA
.It
Megahertz 3CCFEM556BI, 3CXEM556, 3CCFEM556B
.It
OfficeConnect 3CXSH572BT
.It
Farallon EtherMac
.El
.Pp
Various models of these cards come with a different assortment of
connectors:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It AUI/DIX
Standard 15 pin connector, also known as 10base5 (thick-net)
.It 10Base2
BNC, also known as thin-net
.It 10BaseT
UTP, also known as twisted pair
.El
.Pp
The default port to use is the port that has been selected with the
setup utility.
To override this, use the following media options with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or in your
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It 10base5/AUI
Use the AUI port.
.It 10base2/BNC
Use the BNC port.
.It 10baseT/UTP
Use the UTP port.
.El
.Pp
If there are multiple cards in the computer, they are searched for
in the following order: bus, slot, then ethernet address.
.Sh NOTES
The 3c509 card has no jumpers to set the address.
3Com supplies software to set the address of the card in software.
To find the card on the ISA bus, the kernel performs a complex
scan operation at IO address 0x110.
Beware!
Avoid placing other cards at that address!
.Pp
Furthermore,
the 3c509 should only
be configured in EISA mode
when installed in a computer that has actual EISA slots
(and an EISA-aware BIOS).
The normal driver auto-detection support
is sufficient for non-EISA systems.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It ep0: reset (status: %x)
The driver has encountered a FIFO underrun or overrun.
The driver will reset the card and the packet will be lost.
This is not fatal.
.It ep0: eeprom failed to come ready
The eeprom failed to come ready.
This probably means the card is wedged.
.It ep0: 3c509 in test mode. Erase pencil mark!
This means that someone has scribbled with pencil
in the test area on the card.
Erase the pencil mark and reboot.
(This is not a joke).

are great.
There's so many to choose from.
