.Nd device driver for Midway-based ATM interfaces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device en"
.Cd "pseudo-device atm"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Midway-based ATM interfaces including the
Efficient Networks, Inc. ENI-155 and Adaptec ANA-59x0.
Midway is an ALL5 SAR (Segmentation and Reassenbly) chip.
.Pp
The driver only supports ATM PVCs.  SVC or ATM-ARP is not supported.
.Pp
To configure the card for IP, use something like:
.Dl # ifconfig en0 128.252.200.1 netmask 0xffffff00 up
To add a PVC to a host you must use the ``route'' command:
.Dl # route add -iface <remote IP address> -link en0:z.0.x.y
where x and y are the byte encoding of the VCI to use, and z is the
byte encoding of the following flags.
.Dl 0x01 (use AAL5),
.Dl 0x02 (if using AAL5, use a LLCSNAP header)
Thus, parameter 3 means AAL5 and LLC/SNAP encapsulation.
Note that BPF works only with LLC/SNAP encapsulation.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Suppose you have 2 hosts 128.252.200.1 and 128.252.200.2 connected
by ATM through PVC # 201 (0xc9).
To enable the link use the following commands:
.Dl on host 128.252.200.1:
.Dl	# ifconfig en0 128.252.200.1 netmask 0xffffff00 up
.Dl	# route add -iface 128.252.200.2 -link en0:3.0.0.c9
.Pp
.Dl on host 128.252.200.2:
.Dl	# ifconfig en0 128.252.200.2 netmask 0xffffff00 up
.Dl	# route add -iface 128.252.200.1 -link en0:3.0.0.c9
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bd -literal
en0 <Efficient Networks ENI-155p> rev 0 int a irq 5 on pci0:16
en0: ATM midway v0, board IDs 6.0, Utopia (pipelined), 512KB on-board RAM
en0: maximum DMA burst length = 64 bytes
en0: 7 32KB receive buffers, 8 32KB transmit buffers allocated
.Ed
.Sh CAVEATS
The driver extensively uses DMA on PCI.
The first
generation PCI chipsets do not work or exhibit poor performance.
