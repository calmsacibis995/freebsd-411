.Sh NAME
.Nm tx
.Nd "SMC 83c17x Fast Ethernet device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device tx"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Ethernet adapters based on the
SMC 83c17x (EPIC) chips.
These are mostly SMC 9432 series cards.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types (depending on card's capabilities):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autonegotiation (default)
.It 100baseFX
Set 100Mbps (fast ethernet) fiber optic operation
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (fast ethernet) twisted pair operation
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps on 10baseT port
.It 10base2/BNC
Set 10Mbps on 10base2 port
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Set full-duplex operation
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports oversized ethernet packets (up to 1600 bytes).
Refer to the
.Xr ifconfig 8
man page on setting the interface's MTU.
.Pp
The old ``ifconfig tx0 linkN'' method of configuration is not supported.
.Ss "VLAN (IEEE 802.1Q) support"
The
.Nm
driver supports the VLAN operation (using
.Xr vlan 4
intefaces) without decreasing the MTU on the
.Xr vlan 4
interfaces.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "tx%d: device timeout %d packets"
The device stops responding.
Device and driver reset follows this error.
.It "tx%d: PCI fatal error occured (%s)"
One of following errors occured: PCI Target Abort, PCI Master Abort, Data
Parity Error or Address Parity Error.
Device and driver reset follows this error.
.It "tx%d: cannot allocate mbuf header/cluster"
Cannot allocate memory for received packet.
Packet thrown away.
.It "tx%d: can't stop %s DMA"
While resetting, driver failed to stop device correctly.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The multicast packets filtering is not supported.
