.Sh NAME
.Nm ex
.Nd "Ethernet device driver for the Intel EtherExpress Pro/10 and Pro/10+"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device ex0 at isa? port? irq ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the 16-bit PCI Intel EtherExpress Pro/10
and Pro/10+ Ethernet cards based on the Intel i82595 chip.
.Pp
If the port start address isn't found, the card will be searched for in the
I/O address range 0x200 - 0x3a0.  If the IRQ isn't specified, it will be
read from the EEPROM on the card.  For correct operation on newer
cards the Plug-N-Play support should be disabled.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ex%d: Intel EtherExpress Pro/10, address %6D, connector %s"
The device probe found an installed card, and was able to correctly install
the device driver.
.It "ex%d: WARNING: board's EEPROM is configured for IRQ %d, using %d"
The device probe detected that the board is configured for a different
interrupt than the one specified in the kernel configuration file.
.It "ex%d: invalid IRQ."
The device probe detected an invalid IRQ setting.
.El
.Sh BUGS
Currently the driver does not support multicast.
