.Dt POSIX.1B 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm posix1b
.Nd "Posix P1003-1B extensions"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
POSIX.1B adds real time extensions and some commonly used
Berkeley extensions to POSIX.1.
This section contains preliminary information about avoiding conflicts
and adding support for the required ability to specify the interface
version.
.Sh STATUS
March 28, 1998: _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING works with these kernel
options in your configuration:
.Bd -literal -offset 0i
options		"P1003_1B"
options		"_KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING"
.Ed
.Sh SPECIFYING THE VERSION
There are three manifest constants that set the version and programming interface
for POSIX.1B.
.Bd -literal -offset 0i
_POSIX_VERSION
.Ed
specifies the system for which the system is built.  The default
is POSIX.1 and is 199009L.  POSIX.1B is 199309L.  This defines
the base features of the operating system.
.Bd -literal -offset 0i
_POSIX_SOURCE
.Ed
is a macro from POSIX.1 that can
be defined to specify that only POSIX and ANSI functionality should occur
in the name space.
.Bd -literal -offset 0i
_POSIX_C_SOURCE
.Ed
is a macro from POSIX.1B that can be defined to specify that only
POSIX and ANSI functionality from a specific POSIX version should occur
in the name space, i.e., if _POSIX_VERSION is 199309L (POSIX.1B) but
_POSIX_C_SOURCE is 199009L (POSIX.1) then only POSIX.1 features should
appear.
.Sh PROPERLY HIDING EXTENSIONS
The following test macros are set up in <sys/_posix.h>.  They should
used by system header files to avoid the kind of tests you see in
<sys/_posix.h>.  Source programs should not use these
.Fx
specific
implementation details and should test _POSIX_VERSION, _POSIX_SOURCE
and _POSIX_C_SOURCE.
These should not be used in the kernel though - the kernel should be
immune to the user land setting of _POSIX_VERSION.  The P1003_1B option can
be used in the kernel to limit inclusion of new code, but make sure
things work properly when a POSIX.1B program is run on a kernel without
the P1003_1B option.
.Bd -literal -offset 0i
_P1003_1B_VISIBLE
.Ed
is a test macro that sorts out when extensions should be
visible.  It is defined in <sys/_posix.h>.
.Pp
In normal C program development
only _POSIX_VERSION is set, permitting
.Bx
extensions to
appear to the programs.  However, when adding new functionality mandated
by POSIX.1B, it
is important to satisfy the requirements added by the
new _POSIX_C_SOURCE macro.  _P1003_1B_VISIBLE (not a standard feature test macro)
is defined in sys/unistd.h when the combination of _POSIX_VERSION,
_POSIX_SOURCE, and _POSIX_C_SOURCE indicate that the extensions are in scope.
.Bd -literal -offset 0i
_P1003_1B_VISIBLE_HISTORICALLY
.Ed
is present to conditionalize POSIX.1B extensions that were historically
in the system.  These are visible when _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE
are not set at all or when _POSIX_C_SOURCE enables POSIX.1B features.
The intent of this feature test is to permit hiding the new extensions
while still letting
.Bx
extensions show up to avoid breaking existing
programs without trying to use the "big hammer" of _POSIX_C_SOURCE.
.Pp
Some recent additions to header files
are new enough that they should be changed to
be dependent on _P1003_1B_VISIBLE instead of _HISTORICALLY.
.Pp
Traditional
.Bx
headers (e.g., mmap.h) now specified
in POSIX.1B can include <sys/_posix.h> and conditionalize
.Bx
extensions on _P1003_1B_VISIBLE_HISTORICALLY.
.Sh NON STANDARD TEST MACROS
.Bd -literal -offset 0i
_P1003_1B_INCLUDE_MAYBES
.Ed
when set before the inclusion of any other header file
requests that all header files that the POSIX.1B spec says a standard
header may include should be included.  Normally no non-required
headers are included.  Setting this pre-processor definition should
make any compliant program compile without issues of header file
inclusion.
.Bd -literal -offset 0i
P1003_1B
.Ed
is a config option to build in POSIX.1B support in the kernel.
