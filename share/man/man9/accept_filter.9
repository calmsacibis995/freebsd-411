.Sh NAME
.Nm accept_filter ,
.Nm accept_filt_add ,
.Nm accept_filt_del ,
.Nm accept_filt_generic_mod_event ,
.Nm accept_filt_get
.Nd filter incoming connections
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/socket.h
.In sys/socketvar.h
.Ft int
.Fn accept_filt_add "struct accept_filter *filt"
.Ft int
.Fn accept_filt_del "char *name"
.Ft int
.Fn accept_filt_generic_mod_event "module_t mod" "int event" "void *data"
.Ft struct accept_filter *
.Fn accept_filt_get "char *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Accept filters allow an application to request
that the kernel pre-process incoming connections.
An accept filter is requested via the
.Xr setsockopt 2
system call, passing in an
.Fa optname
of
.Dv SO_ACCEPTFILTER .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
A module that wants to be an accept filter
must provide a struct accept_filter to the system:
.Bd -literal
struct accept_filter {
	char	accf_name[16];
	void	(*accf_callback)
		__P((struct socket *so, void *arg, int waitflag));
	void *	(*accf_create)
		__P((struct socket *so, char *arg));
	void	(*accf_destroy)
		__P((struct socket *so));
	SLIST_ENTRY(accept_filter) accf_next;	/* next on the list */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The module should register it with the function
.Fn accept_filt_add ,
passing a pointer to a struct accept_filter, allocated with
.Xr MALLOC 9
.Pp
The fields of
.Fa struct accept_filter
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width accf_callbackXXX
.It accf_name
Name of the filter;
this is how it will be accessed from userland.
.It accf_callback
The callback that the kernel will do
once the connection is established.
It is the same as a socket upcall
and will be called when the connection is established
and whenever new data arrives on the socket,
unless the callback modifies the socket's flags.
.It accf_create
Called whenever a
.Xr setsockopt 2
installs the filter onto
a listening socket.
.It accf_destroy
Called whenever the user removes the accept filter on the socket.
.El
.Pp
.Fn accept_filt_del
passed the same string used in accept_filter.accf_name during registration
with
.Fn accept_filt_add ,
the kernel will then disallow and further userland use of the filter.
.Pp
.Fn accept_filt_get
is used internally to locate which accept filter to use via the
.Fn setsockopt
syscall.
.Pp
.Fn accept_filt_generic_mod_event
provides a simple way to avoid duplicate
code for accept filters which don't use
argument field to load and unload
themselves.  It is a function that can be
put in the load/unload struct
for the
.Fn DECLARE_MODULE
macro.

The accept filter concept was pioneered by David Filo at Yahoo!
and refined to be a loadable module system by Alfred Perlstein.
