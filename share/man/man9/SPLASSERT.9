.Sh NAME
.Nm SPLASSERT
.Nd kernel spl level verification macro
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options INVARIANTS
.Cd options INVARIANT_SUPPORT
.Fn SPLASSERT "char *level" "char *msg"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In a kernel compiled with both "options INVARIANTS"
and "options INVARIANT_SUPPORT",
the
.Fn SPLASSERT
macro compares the current spl level of the kernel with the spl
.Fa level
specified in the macro
.Fn SPLASSERT .
If the specified
.Fa level
is not active
.Fn SPLASSERT
calls the
.Fn KASSERT
macro with the
.Fa msg ,
terminating the running system.
.Pp
In a kernel that does not have both "options INVARIANTS"
and "options INVARIANT_SUPPORT",
the
.Fn SPLASSERT
macro is defined to be a no-op.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The kernel function
.Fn rtalloc
must be called at
.Fn splnet :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
rtalloc(ro)
	register struct route *ro;
{
	SPLASSERT(net, "rtalloc()");
	rtalloc_ign(ro, 0UL);
}
