.Sh NAME
.Nm VOP_ACCESS
.Nd "check access permissions of a file or Unix domain socket"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/vnode.h
.Ft int
.Fn VOP_ACCESS "struct vnode *vp" "int mode" "struct ucred *cred" "struct proc *p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This entry point checks the access permissions of the file against the
given credentials.
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width mode
.It Ar vp
the vnode of the file to check
.It Ar mode
the type of access required
.It Ar cred
the user credentials to check
.It Ar p
the process which is checking
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa mode
is a mask which can contain
.Dv VREAD ,
.Dv VWRITE
or
.Dv VEXEC .
.Sh LOCKS
The vnode will be locked on entry and should remain locked on return.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the file is accessible in the specified way, then zero is returned,
otherwise an appropriate error code is returned.
.Sh PSEUDOCODE
