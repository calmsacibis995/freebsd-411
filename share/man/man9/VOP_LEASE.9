.Sh NAME
.Nm VOP_LEASE
.Nd "validate a vnode for a particular set of credentials and operation type"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/mount.h
.Ft int
.Fn VOP_LEASE "struct vnode *vp" "struct proc *p" "struct ucred *cred" "int type"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This entry point is currently not implemented.  I believe the idea is to
validate a vnode for a particular set of user credentials and operation type.
The two operation types supported are LEASE_READ and LEASE_WRITE.  The
function currently always returns 0.
.Sh LOCKS
The vnode must be exclusively locked on entry, and should remain exclusively
locked on return.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, zero is returned.  Otherwise, well... zero is returned too.
