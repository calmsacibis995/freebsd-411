.Sh NAME
.Nm VOP_LINK
.Nd create a new name for a file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/vnode.h
.Ft int
.Fn VOP_LINK "struct vnode *dvp" "struct vnode *vp" "struct componentname *cnp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This links a new name in the specified directory to an existing file.
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It Ar dvp
the vnode of the directory
.It Ar vp
the vnode of the file to be linked
.It Ar cnp
pathname information about the file
.El
.Pp
The pathname info must be released on exit.  The directory and
file vnodes should NOT be released on exit.
.Sh LOCKS
The directory,
.Fa dvp
is locked on entry and should remain locked on return.
The file
.Fa vp
is not locked on entry and should remain that way on return.
If your VOP code locks
.Fa vp ,
it must be sure to unlock prior to returning.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Zero is returned if the file was linked successfully, otherwise an
error is returned.
.Sh PSEUDOCODE
.Bd -literal
