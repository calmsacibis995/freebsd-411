Each device has a quiet flag associated with it.  A device is
verbose by default when it is created but may be quieted to prevent
the device identification string to be printed during probe.
To quiet a device, call
.Xr device_quiet 9 ,
to reenable to probe message (to make the message appear again, for
example after a
.Xr device_detach 9 )
call
.Xr device_verbose 9 .
To test to see if a device is quieted, call
.Xr device_is_quiet 9 .
