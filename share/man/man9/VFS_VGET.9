Return parameter for the vnode.
.El
.Pp
This is an optional filesystem entrypoint for filesystems which have a
unique id number for every file in the filesystem.  It is used
internally by the UFS filesystem and also by the NFSv3 server to
implement the
.Dv READDIRPLUS
nfs call.
.Pp
If the filesystem does not support this call, then it should return
.Er EOPNOTSUPP .
