.Dt KASSERT 9
.Sh NAME
.Nm KASSERT
.Nd kernel expression verification macro
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options INVARIANTS
.Fn KASSERT expression "const char *msg"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In a kernel compiled with "options INVARIANTS",
the
.Fn KASSERT
macro tests the given
.Ar expression
and if it is false,
calls the
.Fn panic
syscall, terminating the running system.
.Pp
In a kernel that does not have "options INVARIANTS",
the
.Fn KASSERT
macro is defined to be a no-op.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The kernel function
.Fn vput
must not be called with a NULL pointer.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
vput(vp)
        struct vnode *vp;
{
	struct proc *p = curproc;
	KASSERT(vp != NULL, ("vput: null vp"));
	...
}
