.Fn VOP_CLOSE "struct vnode *vp" "int mode" "struct ucred *cred" "struct proc *p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr VOP_OPEN 9
entry point is called before a file is accessed by a process and the
.Xr VOP_CLOSE 9
entry point is called after a file is finished with by the process.

care whether the vnode is locked or not.  The lock and reference state is
left unchanged on return.  Note that
