.Nm
takes any number of device names as arguments, where the names are
the common abbreviation for the device.
There are two special devices,
.Dq std
and
.Dq local .
The former creates the standard devices for the architecture.
The latter is for devices specific to the local site, and
executes the shell file
.Dq Pa MAKEDEV.local .

The i386 supports the following devices.
Where a device name is followed by a hash sign
.Pq Dq # ,
the hash sign
must be replaced by a unit number.
