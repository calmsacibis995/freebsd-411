.Sh NAME
.Nm drivers.conf
.Nd "driver configuration file for boot floppies"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
is used during the release build process.
A
.Fx
release includes two installation floppies.
The first floppy image,
.Pa kern.flp ,
contains a statically linked kernel.
The second floppy image,
.Pa mfsroot.flp ,
contains
.Xr sysinstall 8 ,
a collection of essential commands necessary for installation, and
kernel modules to supplement the boot kernel.
Once the system has booted,
the modules present in the
.Pa /stand/modules
directory of the mfsroot floppy will automatically be loaded by
.Xr sysinstall 8 .
.Pp
The
.Pa /usr/src/release/${arch}/drivers.conf
file contains a list of drivers that should be omitted from the boot
kernel and installed as kernel modules on the mfsroot floppy.
Each driver is described on a separate line; fields on each line are
separated by tabs or spaces.
.Pp
The first field,
.Ar driver ,
is the name of the driver in the kernel configuration file.
This is used by
.Pa driver-remove.pl
to remove drivers from the boot floppy kernel configuration
file that are included as modules on the mfsroot floppy.
.Pp
The second field,
.Ar filename ,
is the name of the associated kernel module (without the
.Pa .ko
extension).
.Pp
The third field,
.Ar floppy ,
specifies which floppy disk should include the kernel module.
Currently, only a value of 2 is valid here (representing
.Pa mfsroot.flp ) .
In the future, a third
.Dq "driver floppy"
may be added.
.Pp
The fourth field,
.Ar type ,
specifies the driver category.
This field is currently unused.
.Pp
The fifth field,
.Ar description ,
provides a short description of the device driver.
