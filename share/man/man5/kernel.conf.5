.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kernel.conf
.Nd configuration for legacy devices
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains configuration entries created by the USERCONFIG mechanism.
This is typically used to force I/O port, memory and IRQ settings for
legacy ISA devices on the i386 platform.
It is typically created during first-time system installation by
.Xr kget 8 .
.Pp
The file
.Pa /boot/loader.conf
must contain this line for the
.Nm
script to be loaded:
.Pp
.Dl userconfig_script_load="YES"
.Pp
The file
.Pa /boot/defaults/loader.conf
contains the following two lines:
.Pp
.Dl userconfig_script_name="/boot/kernel.conf"
.Dl userconfig_script_type="userconfig_script"
.Pp
The kernel must be compiled with the following option:
.Pp
.Dl options USERCONFIG
.Pp
This option is normally present in the GENERIC kernel.
.Sh SYNTAX
Device names must contain both the name of the driver and the instance
number, for example, ed0.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "iom <device> <address>" -compact
.It Sy di <device>
Disable the given device.
.It Sy en <device>
Enable the given device.
.It Sy po <device> <port>
Set the beginning of the device's allocated port range.
.It Sy ir <device> <irq>
Set the device's interrupt request line.
.It Sy dr <device> <dma>
Set the device's dma channel.
.It Sy iom <device> <address>
Set the beginning of the device's allocated memory window.
.It Sy ios <device> <size>
Set the size of the device's allocated memory window.
.It Sy f <device> <flags>
Set arbitrary flags for the device.
.It Sy q
End the configuration file.
