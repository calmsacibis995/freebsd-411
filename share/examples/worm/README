These two shell scripts are what the developers use to burn CDs,
including the FreeBSD releases made for Walnut Creek CDROM.

makecdfs.sh is used to turn an arbitrary tree of files into a single
ISO9660 (with RockRidge extensions) filesystem image.  See the top
of the shell script for usage instructions.

burncd.sh takes the filesystem image produced by makecdfs.sh and burns
it onto a CDR drive.  If you want to simply test your CDR without wasting
a blank, you can also do:

	burncd.sh mybigtestimage dummy

And it will "write" the CD without the laser turned on, so that it's
actually untouched.
