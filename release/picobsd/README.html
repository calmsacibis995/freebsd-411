<h1><b><center>           PicoBSD Development Kit      </center></b></h1>

<p>All documentation, instructions, list of supported hardware and FAQ are
in doc/ directory. If they are missing, go to the doc/src/ subdirectory and
do a 'make'. The docs are marked with HTML tags, but we try to keep
them readable even without a browser.

<p>Please start from <A HREF="doc/intro.html">here</a> for general
description of the project and its features, or just go directly
<A HREF="doc/how2build.html">here</a> for detailed instructions on how to
build your version of PicoBSD.

<p>Enjoy!</p>
