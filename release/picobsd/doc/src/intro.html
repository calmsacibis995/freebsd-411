<A NAME="what"><h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>If you ever dreamed about having really small, tiny, minimal system that
would offer you benefits of Unix, while still fitting in reasonable space -
here it is!</p>

<p>PicoBSD is a one floppy version of 
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> 3.0-current, which in its
different variations allows you to have secure dialup access, small diskless
router or even a dial-in server. And all this on only one standard 1.44MB
floppy - no need to sacrifice over 100MB of your precious HDD space.</p>

<p>PicoBSD is... well, pico-sized :-) , and the minimal hardware that
is required to run it is 386SX CPU with 8MB of RAM (no HDD!).
</p>

<A NAME="hardware">
<p>Here you can find detailed <A HREF="hardware.html">list of supported
hardware and features</a>.

<p>Current version of PicoBSD is @VER@, and this means that I consider it
still immature, while on the other hand being somewhat tested and improved
over previous versions. Does it tell you something? Well, at least you can
try it - I cannot guarantee that it doesn't burn your house or blow up your
machine, though the former is unlikely... :-)</p>

<HR shade align="center">
<A NAME="where"><h3>Where can I get it?</h3>

<p>There are two language editions of PicoBSD - English and Polish one. You'll
be probably more interested in the former :-) The only difference is in
the set of fonts included, C locale, and the language of messages.</p>
<p>You can download them from www.freebsd.org or one of its mirrors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dialup version: <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/pb_en-D.bin">English</a>
(<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/doc_dial/README.en">README</a>) or 
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/pb_pl-D.bin">Polish</a>
(<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/doc_dial/README.pl">README</a>)
</li>
<li>Networking (formerly known as 'router-like') version: <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/pb_en-N.bin">English</a>
(<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/doc_net/README.en">README</a>)
 or <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/pb_pl-N.bin">Polish</a>
(<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/doc_net/README.pl">README</a>)
</li>
<li>Router version: <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/pb_en-R.bin">English</a>
(<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/doc_router/README.en">README</a>)
 or <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/pb_pl-R.bin">Polish</a>
(<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/doc_router/README.pl">README</a>)
</li>
<li>Dial-in server version: waiting for 
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/beta.html">beta testers</a> ... :-)
</ul>

<p><i>(See the <A HREF="hardware.html">feature list</a> for more
details)</i></p>

<p>The above floppies were built from 3.0-current sources. Though they
provide more features, they tend to be less stable than the latest
RELEASE of FreeBSD. Dinesh Nair back-ported these scripts to the
latest release (2.2.5), and continues development of PicoBSD using sources
from that branch. You can find floppies built from 2.2.5 sources 
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd225/">here</a> or at 
<A HREF="http://info.net-gw.com/picoBSD/">his server</a>.</p>

<HR shade align="center">
<A NAME="how"><h3>How can I use it?</h3>
<p>Previous versions were packed with PKZIP(tm) compatible program - now they
are simply the raw binary floppy images, so you just need to grab the
appropriate version of the file.</p>

<p>I assume you will use 1.44MB floppy to boot the system - other sizes
(bigger) are not tested.</p>

<p>The file 'pb_xx-X.bin' must be written onto a blank floppy. It does NOT
mean that it can be copied using e.g. DOS 'copy' command. You must use a 
program like 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/tools/rawrite.exe">rawrite.exe</a>
or
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/tools/fdimage.exe">fdimage.exe</a>
 to write this file directly on the raw floppy.</p>

<p>Under DOS you would do something like this:</p>
<pre>
	C:\> fdimage.exe pb_xx-X.bin a:
</pre>

<p>while under Unix you would use something like:</p>
<pre>
	dd if=pb_xx-X.bin of=/dev/rfd0
</pre>

<p>Then boot off this floppy and enjoy!</p>

<p>If you feel lost, try the 'help' command (it's available only on "dialup"
floppies)</p>

<HR shade align="center">
<A NAME="create">
<h3>Create your own, custom version of PicoBSD!</h3>

<p>I made available also the set of tools
(a.k.a the PicoBSD Development Kit) I used to create the floppies (see also the 
 <A HREF="how2build.html">detailed instructions</a>)</p>

<p>You can also access the full CVS repository of PicoBSD - beginning with
version 0.4 it's a part of official FreeBSD CVS and lives in
<code>src/release/picobsd</code>. I also create the snapshots of this source
tree - keep in mind that they are not so up-to-date as the tree
in FreeBSD CVS. You can get the snapshot I made on 
Sun Nov  1 11:48:32 PST 1998
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/picobsd/picobsd.tgz">here</a>.</p>

<p> Now, if you don't like the setup of PicoBSD, or you miss
some program, or (better yet) you want to improve PicoBSD - you can grab the
copy of exactly the same tools I used and build your own, customized
 version! </p>

<p>Think of it: if your're an ISP, you can build the dialup version for
 your customers, including some scripts to automatically connect them to 
your site. You can also create a demo disk for your friend (or your boss! :-)).
You can also build a firewall/router for your office, etc, etc...
 possibilities are really endless and limited only by your imagination.</p>

<p>You will need at least 10MB of free disk space for building, and of course
the full system sources installed. I also assume that the sources are
quite -current. There is also a back-ported version of the scripts prepared by
<A HREF="mailto:dinesh@alphaque.com">Dinesh Nair</a> which builds ok on
2.2.6-R systems.</p>

<p>Version 0.31 was packed with pax(1) - newer versions are packed again
with tar and gzip to avoid confusion... :-)</p>

<p>I'm very interested in hearing from you about your experiences - if you
come up with a setup you think is interesting, please let me know!</p>

<HR shade align="center">
<A NAME="info"><h3>Where can I get more info?</h3>

<p>Almost all of the programs included on the floppies are exactly the
same versions as in normal FreeBSD installation, so that the normal
manual pages apply. However, I didn't include the manpages themselves - 
they would take over 200kB!</p>

<p> For the total newbies, which would use (I assume)
the 'dialup' version, there is a short README on the floppy which gives
step by step instructions on how to get a dialup connection. There is also
a script called 'dialup' which attempts to configure PPP to allow for automatic
log in to your provider, and for background operation.
There is also a small help system ('help' command)</p>

<p> There are some system utilities which are unique to PicoBSD, and at this
 moment they are documented in detail only in source and READMEs :-(.</p>


<p>As for the new releases which will (hopefully) be prepared in the future:
just keep an eye on this page. I'll also send announcements to FreeBSD mailing
lists.</p>

<HR shade align="center">
<A NAME="future"><h3>Plans for the future</h3>

<p>Well, I hope that thanks to your comments I'll be able to continuously
improve the setup and contents of PicoBSD. I also have specific dreams (if
dreams can be specific..) - here they are, as an incentive to your
imagination and coding skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>
To write a command line tool patterned after Cisco IOS, which could configure
various aspects of router-like version of PicoBSD.
<p>Well, currently you can read very preliminary draft of proposed
architecture, called the <A HREF="UCI.html">Unified Configuration Interface.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
To put an XWindow-like GUI on the 'dialup' floppy. (Update: you can look at
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/preview/preview2.tgz">preview
version</a> and send me your comments. <b>I need some help in porting newer
version of W</b>).
</li>
<li>
To gain some experience with solid state disks, and prepare standard images
for e.g. 4MB versions of SSD, with Cisco 25xx-like contents... I also hope
 to achieve this goal in the nearest
future, thanks to involvement of some PicoBSD enthusiast :-)</p>
(Update: I'm experimenting with an M-System's 16MB flash right now, and
there is also ongoing development for a driver for their DiskOnChip)
</li>
<li>
To be able to boot from more primitive filesystem than FFS - DOS or Minix
would be just fine, as they don't waste so much space for their internals.
</li>
<li>
To have an alternative to current MFS - it wastes a lot of space just
because it mimicks the normal FFS on top of memory blocks...
</li>
<li>
To further minimize the memory footprint of router-like setup. I'd like it
to be able to run truely effortlessly on 4MB machines... This would
probably include rewriting oinit(8) to run multithreaded.
</li>
<li>
And many others... You can find a complete list
<A HREF="TODO.html">here</a>.
</li>
</ul>
