    <h1>Configuring the PicoBSD install floppy</h1>

    <p>The PicoBSD Install Floppy is engineered to be flexible since every
    site has their own needs for an automated install solution.  The
    base package contains tools and frameworks for further
    customization.  </p>

    <h2>Generating an Install Image</h2>
    
    <p>Central to the design of the install floppy is a tarball image of
    the operating system.  The install floppy downloads and extracts
    the image from a master server. </p> 

    <p>To generate the install image:</p>

    <ol>
	<li>Install and configure a machine as it should be
	installed.  
	<ul> 
	  <li><em>Make the template machine as close to the target
	    machines as possible.</em>  System-specific files such as
	    <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> can cause problems if they are
	    specific to a particular disk setup, such as multiple SCSI 
	    disks in the template vs. single IDE disks in the target.
	  <li><em>Try to keep the template as small as practical.</em>
	    The more packages you install on the template, the larger
	    the image becomes.    
	</ul>
      <li>Use tar to create the image.  This shell script is useful
	for automating the process.
	<blockquote><pre>
#!/bin/sh
TARBALL="/fbsdimage.tgz"
GZIP="-9"

tar -cpvzf ${TARBALL} --totals --exclude '/proc/*' --exclude '/var/tmp/*' \
    --exclude '/var/log/*' --exclude '/tmp/*' --exclude '/fbsdimage.tgz' /
	  </pre></blockquote>
	<ul>
	  <li>Use the '--exclude' argument to remove files from the
	    image. 
	  <li>Don't forget to exclude the image itself or your tarball 
	    will be much larger than it should.
	  <li>The <b>GZIP</b> environment variable sets arguments to the
	    gzip command called by tar's z option.
	</ul>
      <li>Copy the image file to your load server into a public FTP
	directory.
    </ol>
	    
    <h2>Configuring the Install Floppy</h2>
    
    <p>Once the install floppy has been built using the PicoBSD build
      script, mount the floppy and modify the install
      script, <tt>/floppy/etc/doinstall</tt>.   <tt>doinstall</tt> is
      called from rc on startup to install the disk image and perform
      whatever other setup tasks are necessary.  The script can set
      network parameters, configure applications, select kernels, or
      whatever else a shell script can do. A handful of useful
      utilities is included on the disk to ease automated installation.</p>

    <p>At minumum, set the URL to the FTP server holding the disk
      image. If you wish, uncomment and modify to taste any of the
      code blocks provided.</p>

    <p>By default, the install floppy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creates one large FreeBSD slice on the first IDE disk (wd0).
      <li>Creates a 256MB swap partition and the rest for a large
	root partition.
      <li>Formats the large partition using <tt>newfs</tt> with
	default parameters. '
      <li>Downloads the image via FTP and feeds it directly into
	<tt>cpio</tt> for extraction.
    </ul>
    
    <P>To modify the disk formatting parameters, modify the
      <tt>/floppy/etc/prepdisk</tt> script.  <tt>prepdisk</tt> is a
      simple awk script that feeds directly into <tt>disklabel</tt>.
      Simply edit the generated partition table to taste.</P>
