			PicoBSD @VER@ (DIALUP flavor)
			---------------------------


What is PicoBSD?
----------------

It's a one floppy version of FreeBSD (please see http://www.freebsd.org),
configured mainly for dialup access. It can be used as a means to read your
mail remotely, or to log in somewhere and do the work there.

What are minimal requirements?
------------------------------

* 386SX CPU or better (this release contains also FPU emulator)
* 8MB RAM - the more the better.
* Modem sitting on COM1-COM4 (default is to use COM2), if you want to have
  a PPP connection.
* Network card: compatible with NE2000, or PCI cards with DEC chipsets
  or 3C509 series (ed, ep and de drivers). There is also driver for Intel
  EtherExpress PCI card (fxp), and Lance/PCnet (lnc).

How to make a dialup connection?
--------------------------------

I recommend running /stand/dialup script, which will additionally configure
the PPP to allow you to automatically connect to your provider, and
will make the ppp to run in background. However, if you like to do it
yourself, or the script doesn't work properly in your case (let me know
this!), here are the steps you should take:

1.	Go to /etc/ppp directory and edit file ppp.conf (using ee editor). You
	should check at least the port number of your modem (it's configured
	on cuaa1==COM2 by default).
2.	After you're happy with it, start 'ppp' program. Enter the terminal
	mode ('term') - you are now directly connected to your modem, so you
	can normally dial the number using AT commands (e.g. atdt555666777),
	and log in to communictaion server. You should see something like
	this:

		(comm server prompt) login: abial
		(comm server prompt) Password: ********

	Then either the comm server automatically switches to PPP, or you
	should issue a command to tell it to do so (e.g. 'go ppp', 'PPP' or
	other). When PPP is started, you should see something like:

		ppp on pico> Packet mode
		PPP on pico>

	Notice the uppercase PPP - it means that the protocol is up, and now
	you're connected. Congratulations. :-)
3.	Your console is blocked now, but you can use other virtual consoles
	available under Alt-Fn.

How to configure my Ethernet card?
----------------------------------

Hopefully your ethernet card is supported by PicoBSD kernel, and in case of
ISA cards you have already set up correctly its parameters in UserConfig
editor. You can check if PicoBSD found your card by looking into startup
messages ('dmesg | more').

The easiest way to do it is to edit /etc/rc.conf file ('ee /etc/rc.conf').
Find the line which says 'network_interfaces' and add the name of your
card to the list. Then add yet another line 'ifconfig_<if_name>' which
actually sets up your IP address and netmask. E.g:

	network_interfaces="lo0 ed0"
	ifconfig_lo0="inet 127.0.0.1"
	ifconfig_ed0="inet 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0"

Then you have to set up your default gateway, which is usually the router
nearest to you (on the same LAN). E.g:

	defaultrouter="192.168.0.100"

Then you save this information on the floppy with 'update' command, and
reboot.

Of course, you can also issue the proper commands by hand:

	ifconfig ed0 inet 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
	route add default 192.168.0.100

Once you do this, you should be able to 'ping' some remote IP address.

Where to get additional info?
-----------------------------

There is official page of this project at:

	http://www.freebsd.org/~picobsd/

You can find some informations there - not too much yet, to be sure... ;-)
I'll put there also new versions of PicoBSD and bugfixes.

I'll be glad hearing from you about your experiences with PicoBSD. Thanks.

Have fun!
