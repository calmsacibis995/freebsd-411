[1mppp[m	Point to Point Protocol client

	Usage:

	ppp [-auto | -background | -direct | -dedicated | -ddial ] [system]

	In case of PicoBSD most probably this will be:

		ppp -background <system_name>

	You should run 'dialup' script to configure automatic dialing. Then
	you can use

		ppp -background dialup

	to connect to your provider.
