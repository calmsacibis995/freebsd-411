[1mps[m	List running processes

	This is a small 'ps' replacement, which uses information
	available via sysctl(3) interface. It's primitive, but
	gives you the most important informations, i.e. how many
	processes are running and on which vty, and the pid number
	to kill some of them. :-)

	Currently, no options are implemented yet.
