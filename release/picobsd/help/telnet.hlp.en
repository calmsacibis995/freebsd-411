[1mtelnet[m	user interface to the TELNET protocol

	Usage:

	telnet [-8] [-E] [-L] [-S tos] [-a] [-c] [-d] [-e char] [-l user]
		[-n tracefile][-r] [host-name [port]]

	Most commonly this will be just:

		telnet <remote_host>

	[1mWARNING:[m Telnet protocol is unsafe, as it passes the
	passwords in clear text over the network. Use 'ssh' instead, where it's
	possible.
