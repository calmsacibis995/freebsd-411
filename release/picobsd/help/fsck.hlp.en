[1mfsck[m	filesystem consistency check and interactive repair

	Usage:

	fsck -p [-f] [-m mode]
	fsck [-b block#] [-c level] [-l maxparallel] [-y] [-n] [-m mode]
		[filesystem] ...

	but in its simplest and most common version:

	fsck -y <filesystem>

	where <filesystem> is a name of the raw device, on which the filesystem
	lies, e.g. /dev/rfd0 for floppy A:, or /dev/rwd0s1 for partition #1 on
	first IDE drive.
