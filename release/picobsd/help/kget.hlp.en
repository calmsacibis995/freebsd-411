[1mkget[m	Get list of kernel configuration.

	This utility allows to gather device configuration which possibly
	was changed in userconfig (-c) session, and to save it to /kernel.config
	file on startup floppy, so that when user boots next time, the
	settings will automatically be changed.

	Usage is straightforward:

		kget [-incore|kernel_name] [vanilla]

	E.g.:	Get device configuration of running kernel

		kget -incore

		Produce list of parameters changed from /stand/vanilla

		kget -incore /stand/vanilla

		(You can redirect the stdout to /kernel.config - this list
		already contains all the requires keywords.)
