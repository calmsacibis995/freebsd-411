[1mmoused[m	mouse daemon

	Usage:

     moused [-3DPRcdfs] [-F rate] [-r resolution] [-S baudrate] [-C threshold]
     [-m N=M] [-z target] [-t mousetype] -p port

	Most common options are:

     -3      Emulate the third (middle) button for 2-button mice. It is emu-
	     lated by pressing the left and right physical buttons simultane-
	     ously.
     -p port Use port to communicate with the mouse.
     -t type
	     microsoft	      Microsoft (2-button) serial mouse protocol.
	     intellimouse     Microsoft IntelliMouse protocol.	Genius Net-
			      Mouse, ASCII Mie Mouse, Logitech MouseMan+ and
			      FirstMouse+ use this protocol too.
	     mousesystems     MouseSystems 5-byte protocol.  3-button mice may
			      use this protocol.
	     mmseries	      MM Series mouse protocol.
	     logitech	      Logitech mouse protocol.	Note that this is for
			      old Logitech models.  mouseman or intellimouse
			      should be specified for newer models.
	     mouseman	      Logitech MouseMan and TrackMan protocol.	Some
			      3-button mice may be compatible with this proto-
			      col.  Note that MouseMan+ and FirstMouse+ use
			      intellimouse protocol rather than this one.
	     glidepoint       ALPS GlidePoint protocol.
	     thinkingmouse    Kensington ThinkingMouse protocol.
	     mmhittab	      Hitachi tablet protocol.

3-button serial mice may have a small switch to choose between
``MS'' and ``PC'', or ``2'' and ``3''.  ``MS'' or ``2'' usually mean
the microsoft protocol.  ``PC'' or ``3'' will choose the
mousesystems protocol.
To test if the selected protocol type is correct for the given mouse, en-
able the mouse pointer in the current virtual console:
	   vidcontrol -m on
start the mouse daemon in the foreground mode:
	   moused -f -p _selected_port_ -t _selected_protocol_
and see if the mouse pointer travels correctly according to the mouse
movement. Then try cut & paste features by clicking the left, right and
middle buttons. Type ^C to stop the command.
