<!--
	The "What's New" section of the release notes.

	Guidelines for new entries:

	1.  If there is some obvious "keyword" associated with an
	entry (such as a manpage entry or an application name), try to
	put it at the start of the sentence.

	2.  Within each subsection (i.e. kernel, security, userland),
	list items in alphabetical order by these keywords.

	Some entries will have no obvious keywords to help with
	ordering.  In sections containing these entries, put those
	containing (e.g.) manpage references first, then some
	suitable SGML comment line as a demarc, then the remaining
	entries.

<sect1 id="new">
  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
    features in &os; since &release.prev;.  Typical release note items
    document new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bugfixes, or contributed software upgrades.  Security
    advisories for the base system that were issued after
    &release.prev; are also listed.</para>

  <sect2 id="security">
    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>A programming error in the &os; Linux binary
      compatibility which allows a local attacker to read
      or write portions of the kernel memory has been fixed.
      For more details, see security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:13.linux.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:13.linux</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Various remotely-exploitable vulnerabilities of
      <application>CVS</application>'s server mode including double-free,
      integer overflow, and buffer overflow which can result
      in information disclosure, denial-of-service, and/or possibly
      arbitrary code execution, have been fixed via an upgrade
      to <application>CVS</application> 1.11.17.
      For more details, see security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:14.cvs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:14</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A bug in the &man.fetch.1; utility which allows
      a malicious HTTP server to cause arbitrary portions of the client's
      memory to be overwritten, has been fixed.
      For more information, see security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:16.fetch.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:16</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A bug in &man.procfs.5; and &man.linprocfs.5;
      which could cause a malicious local user could perform a local
      denial of service attack by causing a system panic, or the user
      could read parts of kernel memory, has been fixed.
      For more information, see security advisory

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para arch="i386">The &man.cp.4; driver has been added for Cronyx Tau-PCI
      synchronous serial adapters.</para>

    <para arch="alpha">The &man.em.4; driver has been added to the kernel
      on the installation media.</para>

    <para>A bug in &man.mmap.2; that pages marked as <literal>PROT_NONE</literal>
      may become readable under certain circumstances, has been fixed.</para>

    <para>Bugs in <function>vm_object_madvise()</function>,
      <function>vm_object_sync()</function>, and
      <function>contigmalloc()</function>
      functions in the &os; virtual memory subsystem have been fixed.
      The bugs in <function>vm_object_madvise()</function>
      and <function>vm_object_sync()</function> could
      cause memory corruption in a variety of contexts, and
      one in <function>contigmalloc()</function>
      could cause a system panic.</para>

    <sect3 id="proc">
      <title>Platform-Specific Hardware Support</title>

      <para arch="i386">The &man.pbio.4; driver,
	which supports direct access to
	the Intel 8255A programmable peripheral interface (PPI)
	chip running in mode 0 (simple I/O) has been added.</para>

      <para arch="alpha">Support for the floppy interface is broken on
        DS10-class systems.  The kernel probes the hardware correctly but
        the floppy does not work properly.  Booting and installing from
        floppies is not affected.
      </para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="net-if">
      <title>Network Interface Support</title>

      <para>The &man.axe.4; driver, which supports
	ASIX Electronics AX88172 USB 2.0 Ethernet chipset
	has been added.</para>

      <para>The &man.bge.4; driver now supports BCM5750
	and BCM5751.</para>

      <para>The &man.em.4; driver now supports 82541ER and 82546GB
	dual port PCI Express adapter.</para>

      <para>The &man.ixgb.4; driver, which supports PCI Gigabit
	Ethernet adapters based on the Intel 82597EX Ethernet
	controller chips, has been added.</para>

      <para>The &man.ng.hub.4; Netgraph node type, which supports

	&man.rl.4;, &man.sis.4;, &man.ste.4;, and &man.vr.4;)
	now also support this capability and it can be controlled
	via &man.ifconfig.8;.</para>

      <para>A system panic which occurs
	when <varname>net.inet.ip.rtexpire</varname> and/or
	<varname>net.inet6.ip6.rtexpire</varname> are set to
	<literal>0</literal> has been fixed.

    <sect3 id="net-proto">
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>The random ephemeral port allocation, which come from OpenBSD
	has been implemented.  This is enabled by default and can be disabled
	using the <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.randomized</varname>
	sysctl.  Note that the randomization can lead to extremely
	fast port reuse at high connection rates, which is causing
	problems for some users.  To retain the security advantage
	of random ports and ensure correct operation, it is disabled
	during periods of high connection rates.
	More specifically, when the connection rate exceeds
	the value of the <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.randomcps</varname> sysctl
	(<literal>10</literal> by default), the randomization will be disabled for
	seconds specified in the
	<varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.randomtime</varname> sysctl
	(<literal>45</literal> by default).</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.4; now supports lookup tables.  This feature is
        useful for handling large sparse address sets.</para>

      <para>&man.ipnat.8; now allows redirect rules to work for
	non-TCP/UDP packets.</para>

      <para>The <literal>RST</literal>
	handling of the &os; TCP stack has been improved
	to make reset attacks as difficult as possible while
	maintaining compatibility with the widest range of TCP stacks.
	The algorithm is as follows.  For connections in the
	<literal>ESTABLISHED</literal>
	state, only resets with sequence numbers exactly matching
	<varname>last_ack_sent</varname> will cause a reset,
	all other segments will
	be silently dropped. For connections in all other states,
	a reset anywhere in the window will cause the connection
	to be reset.  All other segments will be silently dropped.
	Note that this breaks the RFC 793 specification and you
	can still disable this and use the conventional behavior
	by setting a new sysctl <varname>net.inet.tcp.insecure_rst</varname>
	to <literal>1</literal>.</para>

    <sect3 id="disks">
      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para>The &man.ips.4; driver, which supports IBM/Adaptec ServeRAID controller
	has been added.</para>

      <para>The &man.mpt.4; driver now supports LSI Logic FC929X
	Dual 2Gb/s Fibre Channel card.</para>

      <para>The &man.trm.4; driver now supports the DC395U2W adapters
	and problems under heavy load have been fixed.</para>
    </sect3>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="userland">
    <title>Userland Changes</title>

    <para>The &man.cron.8 daemon now accepts two new options,
      <option>-j</option> and <option>-J</option>, to enable
      time jitter for jobs to run as unprivileged users and the
      superuser, respectively.  Time jitter means that &man.cron.8
      will sleep for a small random period of time in the specified
      range before executing a job.  This feature is intended to
      smooth load peaks appearing when a lot of jobs are scheduled
      for a particular moment.</para>

    <para>The &man.fwcontrol.8; now supports a <option>-m</option>
      option to set the default <literal>fwmem</literal> target.</para>

    <para>The <option>-C 60</option> option is now used
      in the default <varname>$inetd_flags</varname> variable
      in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.</para>

    <para>The <application>libc</application> now supports
      &man.eui64.3; functions.</para>

    <para>The &man.ngctl.8; now supports <command>dot</command> command to
      produce a <application>GraphViz</application> (.dot)
      of the entire Netgraph.</para>

    <para>The LQM, Link Quality Monitoring support in &man.ppp.8;
      has been reimplemented.  The LQM, which is described
      in RFC 1989, allows PPP to keep track of the quality
      of a running connection.</para>

    <para>The userland &man.ppp.8; implementation now supports a <quote>set rad_alive
	<replaceable>N</replaceable></quote> command
      to enable periodic RADIUS accounting information
      being sent to the RADIUS server.</para>

    <para>A bug in &man.rarpd.8; that prevents it from working properly
      when a interface has more than one IP address has been fixed.</para>

    <para>&man.syslogd.8; now supports <literal>LOG_NTP</literal>
      facility.</para>

    <para>Several off-by-one errors and potential buffer
      overruns in &man.pax.1; have been fixed.</para>

    <para>&man.whois.1; now supports NORID (Norwegian top level registry)
      handles, the German whois nameserver, and a <option>-k</option> flag
      for querying <hostid role="fqdn">whois.krnic.net</hostid>
      (the National Internet Development Agency of Korea)
      which hold details of IP address allocations within Korea.</para>

<sect1 id="upgrade">
  <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

  <para>If you're upgrading from a previous release of &os;, you
    generally will have three options:

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Using the binary upgrade option of &man.sysinstall.8;.
	  This option is perhaps the quickest, although it presumes
	  that your installation of &os; uses no special compilation
	  options.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Performing a complete reinstall of &os;.  Technically,
	  this is not an upgrading method, and in any case is usually less
	  convenient than a binary upgrade, in that it requires you to
	  manually backup and restore the contents of
	  <filename>/etc</filename>.  However, it may be useful in
	  cases where you want (or need) to change the partitioning of
	  your disks.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>From source code in <filename>/usr/src</filename>.  This
	  route is more flexible, but requires more disk space, time,
	  and technical expertise.  More information can be found
	  in the <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html"><quote>Using

	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">FreeBSD
	  Handbook</ulink>.  Upgrading from very old
	  versions of &os; may be problematic; in cases like this, it
	  is usually more effective to perform a binary upgrade or a
	  complete reinstall.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>Please read the <filename>INSTALL.TXT</filename> file for more
    information, preferably <emphasis>before</emphasis> beginning an
    upgrade.  If you are upgrading from source, please be sure to read
    <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> as well.</para>

  <para>Finally, if you want to use one of various means to track the
    -STABLE or -CURRENT branches of &os;, please be sure to consult
    the <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html"><quote>-CURRENT
