.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_std ,
.Nm mount_fdesc ,
.Nm mount_linprocfs ,
.Nm mount_procfs
.Nd mount
.Dq standard
filesystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_ Ns Ar fsname
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Ar "fs"
.Ar mount_point
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is a generic mechanism for attaching ``standard'' filesystems to
the filesystem.  The
.Nm
command currently supports the following filesystems:
.Nm fdesc ,
.Nm linprocfs
and
.Nm procfs .
A ``standard'' filesystem is one which:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
accepts only the standard
.Fl o
options
.Dq ro
.Pq Dq rdonly ,
.Dq rw ,
.Dq nodev ,
.Dq noexec ,
.Dq nosuid ,
and
.Dq union .
.It
has a kernel filesystem module name the same as its user-visible name.
.It
requires no other special processing on the part of the
.Nm
command.
.El
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl o
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
command examines its zeroth command-line argument (the name by which
it was called) to determine the type of filesystem to be mounted.  If
it is called by a name which does not end in
.Dq Li _ Ns Ar fsname ,
.Nm
will assume (for compatibility
with
.Xr mount 8 )
that the zeroth argument contains only the name of the filesystem type.
The
.Nm
command is normally installed with appropriate links to commands for
the distributed filesystems which can be mounted in this way;
for information on the function of each filesystem, see the manual page
for that specific
.Nm mount_ Ns Ar fsname
command.
.Pp
Refer to the following manual pages for detailed information
on these file system:
.Xr fdesc 5 ,
.Xr linprocfs 5
and
.Xr procfs 5 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It argv[0] must end in _fsname
.Nm Mount_std
was called with a zeroth argument of
.Dq Li mount_std .
.It vfsload(%s)
.Nm Mount_std
was unable to load a kernel module implementing the %s filesystem
type.
.It %s filesystem not available
The specified filesystem type was not present in the kernel and no
loadable module for it was found.

.Sh CAVEATS
None of the ``standard'' filesystems may be NFS-exported.
