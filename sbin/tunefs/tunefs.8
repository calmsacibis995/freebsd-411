.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Tunefs
is designed to change the dynamic parameters of a filesystem
which affect the layout policies.
The parameters which are to be changed are indicated by the flags
given below:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A
The filesystem has several backups of the super-block.  Specifying
this option will cause all backups to be modified as well as the
primary super-block.  This is potentially dangerous - use with caution.
.It Fl a Ar maxcontig
Specify the maximum number of contiguous blocks that will
be laid out before forcing a rotational delay (see
.Fl d
below).
The default value is one, since most device drivers require
an interrupt per disk transfer.
Device drivers that can chain several buffers together in a single
transfer should set this to the maximum chain length.
.It Fl d Ar rotdelay
Specify the expected time (in milliseconds)
to service a transfer completion
interrupt and initiate a new transfer on the same disk.
It is used to decide how much rotational spacing to place between
successive blocks in a file.
.It Fl e Ar maxbpg
Indicate the maximum number of blocks any single file can
allocate out of a cylinder group before it is forced to begin
allocating blocks from another cylinder group.
Typically this value is set to about one quarter of the total blocks
in a cylinder group.
The intent is to prevent any single file from using up all the
blocks in a single cylinder group,
thus degrading access times for all files subsequently allocated
in that cylinder group.
The effect of this limit is to cause big files to do long seeks
more frequently than if they were allowed to allocate all the blocks
in a cylinder group before seeking elsewhere.
For filesystems with exclusively large files,
this parameter should be set higher.
.It Fl f Ar avgfilezsize
Specify the expected average file size.
.It Fl m Ar minfree
Specify the percentage of space held back
from normal users; the minimum free space threshold.
The default value used is 8%.
This value can be set to zero, however up to a factor of three
in throughput will be lost over the performance obtained at a 10%
threshold.
Settings of 5% and less force space optimization to
always be used which will greatly increase the overhead for file
writes.
Note that if the value is raised above the current usage level,
users will be unable to allocate files until enough files have
been deleted to get under the higher threshold.
.It Fl n Ar enable | disable
Turn on/off soft updates.
.It Fl o Ar space | time
The filesystem can either try to minimize the time spent
allocating blocks, or it can attempt to minimize the space
fragmentation on the disk.
Optimization for space has much
higher overhead for file writes.
The kernel normally changes the preference automatically as
the percent fragmentation changes on the filesystem.
.It Fl p
Show a summary of what the current tunable settings
are on the selected filesystem.  More detailed information can be
obtained in the
.Xr dumpfs 8
manual page.
.It Fl s Ar avgfpdir
Specify the expected number of files per directory.

.Sh BUGS
This program should work on mounted and active filesystems.
Because the super-block is not kept in the buffer cache,
the changes will only take effect if the program
is run on dismounted filesystems.
To change the root filesystem, the system must be rebooted
after the filesystem is tuned.
.\" Take this out and a Unix Demon will dog your steps from now until
.\" the time_t's wrap around.
.Pp
You can tune a filesystem, but you can't tune a fish.
