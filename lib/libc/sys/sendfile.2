.Dt SENDFILE 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sendfile
.Nd send a file to a socket
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/socket.h
.In sys/uio.h
.Ft int
.Fn sendfile "int fd" "int s" "off_t offset" "size_t nbytes" "struct sf_hdtr *hdtr" "off_t *sbytes" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Sendfile
sends a regular file specified by descriptor
.Fa fd
out a stream socket specified by descriptor
.Fa s .
.Pp
The
.Fa offset
argument specifies where to begin in the file.
The
.Fa nbytes
argument specifies how many bytes of the file should be sent, with 0 having the special
meaning of send until the end of file has been reached.
.Pp
An optional header and/or trailer can be sent before and after the file data by specifying
a pointer to a struct sf_hdtr, which has the following structure:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
struct sf_hdtr {
	struct iovec *headers;	/* pointer to header iovecs */
	int hdr_cnt;		/* number of header iovecs */
	struct iovec *trailers;	/* pointer to trailer iovecs */
	int trl_cnt;		/* number of trailer iovecs */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa headers
and
.Fa trailers
pointers, if non-NULL, point to arrays of struct iovec structures.
See the
.Fn writev
system call for information on the iovec structure.
The number of iovecs in these
arrays is specified by
.Fa hdr_cnt
and
.Fa trl_cnt .
.Pp
If non-NULL, the system will write the total number of bytes sent on the socket to the
variable pointed to by
.Fa sbytes .
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument is currently undefined and should be specified as 0.
.Pp
When using a socket marked for non-blocking I/O,
.Fn sendfile
may send fewer bytes than requested.
In this case, the number of bytes successfully
written is returned in
.Fa *sbytes
(if specified),
and the error
.Er EAGAIN
is returned.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The
.Fx
implementation of
.Fn sendfile
is "zero-copy", meaning that it has been optimized so that copying of the file data is avoided.
.Sh TUNING
Internally, this system call uses a special
.Xr sendfile 2
buffer
.Pq Vt "struct sf_buf"
to handle sending file data to the client.
If the sending socket is
blocking, and there are not enough sendfile buffers available,
.Xr sendfile 2
will block and report a state of
.Dq Li sfbufa .
If the sending socket is non-blocking and there are not enough
sendfile buffers available, the call will block and wait for the
necessary buffers to become available before finishing the call.
.Pp
The number of
.Vt sf_buf Ns 's
allocated should be proportional to the number of nmbclusters used to
send data to a client via
.Xr sendfile 2 .
Tune accordingly to avoid blocking!
Busy installations that make extensive use of
.Xr sendfile 2
may want to increase these values to be inline with their
.Va kern.ipc.nmbclusters
(see
.Xr tuning 7
for details).
.Pp
The number of
.Xr sendfile 2
buffers available is determined at boot time by either the
.Va kern.ipc.nsfbufs
.Xr loader.conf 5
variable or the
.Dv NSFBUFS
kernel configuration tunable.
The number of sendfile buffers scales with
.Va kern.maxusers .
.Va kern.ipc.nsfbufsused
and
.Va kern.ipc.nsfbufspeak
read-only sysctl variables show current and peak
.Xr sendfile 2
buffers usage respectively.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std sendfile
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
.Fa fd
is not a valid file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EBADF
.Fa s
is not a valid socket descriptor.
.It Bq Er ENOTSOCK
.Fa s
is not a socket.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa fd
is not a regular file.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa s
is not a SOCK_STREAM type socket.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa offset
is negative or out of range.
.It Bq Er ENOTCONN
.Fa s
points to an unconnected socket.
.It Bq Er EPIPE
The socket peer has closed the connection.
.It Bq Er EIO
An error occurred while reading from
.Fa fd .
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An invalid address was specified for a parameter.
.It Bq Er EINTR
A signal interrupted sendfile before it could be completed. If specified, the number
of bytes successfully sent will be returned in
.Fa *sbytes .
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The socket is marked for non-blocking I/O and not all data was sent due to the socket buffer being filled.
If specified, the number of bytes successfully sent will be returned in
.Fa *sbytes .
