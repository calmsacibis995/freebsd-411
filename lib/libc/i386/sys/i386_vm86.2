.Sh NAME
.Nm i386_vm86
.Nd control vm86-related functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In machine/sysarch.h
.In machine/vm86.h
.Ft int
.Fn i386_vm86 "int function" "void *data"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn i386_vm86
is used to call various vm86 related functions.
.Fa function
can be one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width VM86_SET_VME
.It Dv VM86_INIT
This will initialize the kernel's vm86 parameter area for the
process, and permit the process to make vm86 calls.
.Fa data
points to the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct vm86_init_args {
        int     debug;
        int     cpu_type;
        u_char  int_map[32];
};
.Ed
.Pp
.Fa debug
is used to turn on debugging code.
.Fa cpu_type
controls the type of CPU being emulated, and is currently unimplemented.
.Fa int_map
is a bitmap which determines whether vm86 interrupts should be handled
in vm86 mode, or reflected back to the process.  If the
.Em Nth
bit is set, the interrupt will be reflected to the process, otherwise
it will be dispatched by the vm86 interrupt table.
.\" .It Dv VM86_SET_VME
.\" .It Dv VM86_GET_VME
.\" .It Dv VM86_INTCALL
.El
.Pp
vm86 mode is entered by calling
.Xr sigreturn 2
with the correct machine context for vm86, and with the
.Em PSL_VM
bit set.  Control returns to the process upon delivery of a signal.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std i386_vm86
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn i386_vm86
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The kernel does not have vm86 support, or an invalid function was specified.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
There is not enough memory to initialize the kernel data structures.
