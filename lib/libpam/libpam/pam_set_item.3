.In security/pam_modules.h
.Ft int
.Fn pam_set_item "pam_handle_t *pamh" "int type" "const void *item"
.Ft int
.Fn pam_get_item "const pam_handle_t *pamh" "int type" "const void **item"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pam_set_item
and
.Fn pam_get_item
allow applications and modules to store and retrieve a variety of
authentication parameters, or
.Dq items .
Each item is identified by an integer constant.
The following items are defined:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv PAM_USER_PROMPT"
.It Dv PAM_SERVICE
(string)
The name of the requesting service.
.It Dv PAM_USER
(string)
The name of the user the application wants to authenticate.
.It Dv PAM_USER_PROMPT
(string)
The string which will be used to prompt the user for an authentication
token.
.It Dv PAM_TTY
(string)
The name of the current terminal (for terminal-oriented applications)
or display (for X11 applications).
.It Dv PAM_RUSER
(string)
The name of the requesting user.
.It Dv PAM_RHOST
(string)
The name of the host the requesting user is logging in from.
.It Dv PAM_AUTHTOK
(opaque)
The current authentication token.
This item is only accessible from PAM modules.
.It Dv PAM_OLDAUTHTOK
(opaque)
The expired authentication token.
This item is only accessible from PAM modules.
.It Dv PAM_CONV
.Pq Vt "struct pam_conv"
The current conversation function.
The
.Vt pam_conv
structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
struct pam_conv {
    int (*conv)(int num_msg,
        const struct pam_message **msg,
        struct pam_response **resp,
        void *appdata_ptr);
    void *appdata_ptr;
};
.Ed
.It Dv PAM_FAIL_DELAY
.Pq Vt delay_fn
A pointer to a callback function that should be called when a module
wants to introduce a delay after a failed authentication to discourage
brute-force attacks.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn pam_set_item
and
.Fn pam_get_item
functions return one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv PAM_SYSTEM_ERR"
.It Dv PAM_SUCCESS
The operation succeeded.
.It Dv PAM_SYSTEM_ERR
The
.Fa pamh
argument was invalid.
.It Dv PAM_BUF_ERR
A call to
.Xr malloc 3
failed, or the
.Fa item
argument to
.Fn pam_get_item
was
.Dv NULL .
.It Dv PAM_BAD_ITEM
The specified
.Fa item
does not exist or is not accessible to the caller.
.El
.Pp
The
.Xr pam_strerror 3
function can be used to translate these return codes to descriptive
messages.
