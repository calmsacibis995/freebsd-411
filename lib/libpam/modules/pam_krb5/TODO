Things for 1.1, in no particular order:

Check against Solaris 7, Solaris 8 beta. Check SEAM compatibility.
Check against Linux (Redhat, others?).
Check against HPUX.
Fix PAM flags checking.
Add more debugging for successful calls.
Move "entry" debugging up.
Check bounds on str* calls. [paranoia]

Get defaults from krb5.conf?
** Allow no-xrealm, this module typically used for local login **
** Add notes about runtime text relocation on Solaris **
