I. Kerberos notes

This PAM module requires the MIT 1.1+ release of Kerberos, or the Cygnus
CNS distribution. It has not been tested against heimdal or any other
Kerberos distributions.

Unlike other PAM Kerberos 5 modules out there, this one does not
use any private Kerberos interfaces. Thus, you need only the
header files and libraries that are part of the Kerberos distribution.


II. OS notes

This software has been tested against Solaris 2.6. It should compile
against Linux (distributions?) with minimal (if any) changes. Reports
of OS [in]compatibilities are welcomed.

dtlogin on Solaris doesn't support xrealm logins (probably a good thing).

III. PAM notes/open issues

auth module:
When is pam_sm_setcred() ever called with flags other than PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED?
It would be fairly easy to support PAM_DELETE_CRED.

acct module:
I believe this to be complete.

session module:
This is complete (both functions just return success).

passwd module:
When is pam_sm_chauthtok() ever called with flags other than
PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK?


IV. Usage

Simply change /etc/pam.conf to include this module. Make sure to include
the acct category whenever you use the auth category, or .k5login will
not get checked.

You probably want to make this module "sufficient", before your unix
(or other) module(s).


V. Acknowledgements

Thanks to Naomaru Itoi <itoi@eecs.umich.edu>,
Curtis King <curtis.king@cul.ca>, and Derrick Brashear <shadow@dementia.org>,
all of whom have written and made available Kerberos 4/5 modules.
Although no code in this module is directly from these author's modules,
(except the get_user_info() routine in support.c; derived from whichever
of these authors originally wrote the first module the other 2 copied from),
it was extremely helpful to look over their code which aided in my design.
