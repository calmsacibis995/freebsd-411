To strip down a new version of Linux PAM for import, extract
the files like this:

    tar -xvzf pam-xxx.tar.gz -X FREEBSD-Xlist

If you decide to bring in more of the files, import them -- don't
use "cvs add".  And please remember to adjust the contents of
"FREEBSD-Xlist" so that it reflects what is really imported from
the vendor.
