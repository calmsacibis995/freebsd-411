Here are some things to think about if you are interested in
contributing to the Linux-PAM effort.

1. If you have a suggestion mail the pam-list!

2. TODO:		Comments
   -----		--------

 [modules]

pam_time		should log an error if it denies access.

pam_smartcard??  	It has already started to happen. (Alex Yuriev has a
			smart-card module...)

pam_floppy??		A alternative login mechanism might involve
			authenticating with a personal specially
			formatted floppy!? (got to make some use of
			all those strange Linux incompatible floppies
			I keep getting from ISPs ;^)

pam_???			If you are interested in another type of
			authentication method--just make a module!
			If you want it registered/some help, email the
			list.

 [misc]

SVGA & X-conv		Currently, libpam-misc contains a text-only
			conversation function. A graphical one,
			for X or SVGA would be very welcome,
			[Ben Buxton is working on an X one (as of
			1996/12/1)] applications like xlock
			etc.. would benefit from this.


Issues that need to be resolved:
--------------------------------

- can we support the use_mapped_pass flag without running into problems
  with ITAR rules? [this problem is likely to mutate. The DCE-RFC
  people are considering the addition of a mapping module type - one
  that other modules can use to safely store passwords...]

  - anyone know where someone to email for FREE legal advice/support?
