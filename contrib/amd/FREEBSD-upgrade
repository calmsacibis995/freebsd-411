AMD (am-utils) 6.0.3s1
    originals can be found at: ftp://shekel.mcl.cs.columbia.edu/pub/am-utils/
    (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ezk/am-utils/index.html)


For the import of AMD many files were pruned by:

	tar -X FREEBSD-Xlist -xzf am-utils-6.0.3s1.tar.gz

Then imported by:

	cvs import -m 'Virgin import of AMD (am-utils) v6.0.3s1' \
		src/contrib/amd COLUMBIA amd_6_0_3s1

After the import, a separate extraction of am-utils was GNU configured in
the "normal" way.  The resulting config.h file should be compared with
src/usr.sbin/amd/include/config.h, and src/usr.sbin/amd/include/config.h
updated as needed.

To make local changes to amd, simply patch and commit to the main
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the vendor (COLUMBIA) branch.

All local changes should be submitted to "amd-dev@majordomo.cs.columbia.edu"
for inclusion in the next vendor release.
