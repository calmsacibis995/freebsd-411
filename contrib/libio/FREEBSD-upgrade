For the import of libio, files were pruned by:

	tar xvypf gcc-2.95.2.tar.bz2 '*/libio'

Then imported by:

	cvs import -m  \
	   "Virgin import of GCC 2.95.2's libio -- the C++ iostream facility." \
		src/contrib/libio FSF gcc_2_95_2


To make local changes to libio, simply patch and commit to the main
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the vendor (FSF) branch.

All local changes should be submitted to "gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org".
