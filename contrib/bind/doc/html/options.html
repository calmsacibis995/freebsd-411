<A NAME="Usage"><H3>Definition and Usage</H3></A>

<P>The options statement sets up global options to be used by
BIND. This statement may appear at only once in a
configuration file; if more than one occurrence is found, the
first occurrence determines the actual options used,
and a warning will be generated.  If there is no options statement,
an options block with each option set to its default will be used.</P>

<H4>Server Information</H4>

<DL>
<DT><CODE>hostname</CODE>
<DD>
This defaults to the hostname of the machine hosting the nameserver
as found by gethostname().
Its prime purpose is to be able to identify which of a number of anycast
servers is actually answering your queries by sending a <I>txt</I>
query for <CODE>hostname.bind</CODE> in class <I>chaos</I> to the anycast
server and getting back a unique name.
Setting the hostname to a empty string ("") will disable processing of
the queries.

<DT><CODE>version</CODE>
<DD>
The version the server should report via the <VAR>ndc</VAR> command
or via a query of name <CODE>version.bind</CODE> in class <I>chaos</I>.
The default is the real version number of the server, but some server
operators prefer the string <CODE>"surely you must be joking"</CODE>.
Changing the value of this string will not prevent people from identifying
what version you are running.
</DL>

<H4>Pathnames</H4>

<DL>
<DT><CODE>directory</CODE>
<DD>
The working directory of the server.  Any non-absolute
pathnames in the configuration file will be taken as relative to this
directory.  The default location for most server output files
(e.g. "named.run") is this directory.  If a directory is not
specified, the working directory defaults to ".", the directory from which the
server was started.  The directory specified should be an absolute path.

<DT><CODE>named-xfer</CODE>
<DD>
The pathname to the named-xfer program that the server uses for
inbound zone transfers.  If not specified, the default is
system dependent (e.g.  "/usr/sbin/named-xfer").

<DT><CODE>dump-file</CODE>
<DD>
The pathname of the file the server dumps the database to when it
receives <CODE>SIGINT</CODE> signal (<CODE>ndc dumpdb</CODE>).  If not
specified, the default is "named_dump.db".

<DT><CODE>memstatistics-file</CODE>
<DD>
The pathname of the file the server writes memory usage statistics to, on exit,
if <CODE>deallocate-on-exit</CODE> is <CODE>yes</CODE>.  If not
specified, the default is "named.memstats".

<DT><CODE>pid-file</CODE>
<DD>
The pathname of the file the server writes its process ID in.  If not
specified, the default is operating system dependent, but is usually
"/var/run/named.pid" or "/etc/named.pid".  The pid-file is used by
programs like "ndc" that want to send signals to the running
nameserver.

<DT><CODE>statistics-file</CODE>
<DD>
The pathname of the file the server appends statistics to when it
receives <CODE>SIGILL</CODE> signal (<CODE>ndc stats</CODE>).  If not
specified, the default is "named.stats".
</DL>

<A name="BooleanOptions"><H4>Boolean Options</H4></A>

<DL>
<DT><CODE>auth-nxdomain</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE>, the <CODE>AA</CODE> bit is always set on
NXDOMAIN responses, even if the server is not actually authoritative.
The default is <CODE>no</CODE>.  Turning <CODE>auth-nxdomain</CODE> will
allow older clients that require <CODE>AA</CODE> to be set to accept
NXDOMAIN responses to work.

<DT><CODE>deallocate-on-exit</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE>, the server will painstakingly deallocate every object it
it allocated, when it exits, and then write a memory usage report to
the <CODE>memstatistics-file</CODE>.  The default is <CODE>no</CODE>, because
it is faster to let the operating system clean up.
<CODE>deallocate-on-exit</CODE> is handy for detecting memory leaks.

<DT><CODE>dialup</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE>, the server treats all zones as if they are
doing zone transfers across a dial on demand dialup link, which can
be brought up by traffic originating from this server.  This has
different effects according to zone type and concentrates the zone
maintenance so that it all happens in a short interval, once every 
<CODE>heartbeat-interval</CODE> and hopefully during the one call.
It also suppresses some of the normal zone maintainance traffic.
The default is <CODE>no</CODE>. The <CODE>dialup</CODE>
option may also be specified in the <CODE>zone</CODE> statement, in which
case it overrides the <CODE>options dialup</CODE> statement.

<P>
If the zone is a <CODE>master</CODE> zone, the server will send out
NOTIFY request to all the slaves.  This will trigger the "zone up to
date checking" in the slave (providing it supports NOTIFY), allowing
the <CODE>slave</CODE> to verify the zone while the call us up.

<P>
If the zone is a <CODE>slave</CODE> or <CODE>stub</CODE> zone, the server
will suppress the regular "zone up to date" queries and only perform
them when the <CODE>heartbeat-interval</CODE> expires.

<DT><CODE>fake-iquery</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE>, the server will simulate the obsolete DNS query type
IQUERY.  The default is <CODE>no</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>fetch-glue</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE> (the default), the server will fetch "glue" resource
records it doesn't have when constructing the additional data section of
a response.  <CODE>fetch-glue no</CODE> can be used in conjunction with
<CODE>recursion no</CODE> to prevent the server's cache from growing or
becoming corrupted (at the cost of requiring more work from the client).

<DT><CODE>has-old-clients</CODE>
<DD>
Setting the option to <CODE>yes</CODE> is equivalent to setting the following
options: <CODE>auth-nxdomain yes;</CODE> and <CODE>rfc2308-type1 no;</CODE>.
The use of <CODE>has-old-clients</CODE> with <CODE>auth-nxdomain</CODE>
and <CODE>rfc2308-type1</CODE> is order dependent.

<DT><CODE>host-statistics</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE>, statistics are kept for every host that the
the nameserver interacts with.  The default is <CODE>no</CODE>.  <I>Note:</I>
turning on <CODE>host-statistics</CODE> can consume huge amounts of memory.

<DT><CODE>host-statistics-max</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum number of host records that will be kept.  When this limit is
reached no new hosts will be added to the host statistics.  If the set
to zero then there is no limit set.  The default value is zero.

<DT><CODE>maintain-ixfr-base</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE>, a transaction log is kept for 
Incremental Zone Transfer. The default is <CODE>no</CODE>. 

<DT><CODE>multiple-cnames</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE>, multiple CNAME resource records will be
allowed for a domain name.  The default is <CODE>no</CODE>.  Allowing
multiple CNAME records is against standards and is not recommended.
Multiple CNAME support is available because previous versions of BIND
allowed multiple CNAME records, and these records have been used for load
balancing by a number of sites.

<DT><CODE>notify</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE> (the default), DNS NOTIFY messages are sent when a
zone the server is authoritative for changes.  The use of NOTIFY
speeds convergence between the master and its slaves.  Slave servers
that receive a NOTIFY message, and understand it, will contact the
master server for the zone to see if they need to do a zone transfer.  If
they do, they will initiate it immediately.  If <CODE>explicit</CODE>,
the NOTIFY messages will only be sent to the addresses in the
<CODE>also-notify</CODE> list.  The <CODE>notify</CODE>
option may also be specified in the <CODE>zone</CODE> statement, in which
case it overrides the <CODE>options notify</CODE> statement.

<DT><CODE>suppress-initial-notify</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE>, suppress the initial notify messages when the server
first loads.  The default is <CODE>no</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>recursion</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE>, and a DNS query requests recursion, the
server will attempt to do all the work required to answer the query.
If recursion is not on, the server will return a referral to the
client if it doesn't know the answer.  The default is <CODE>yes</CODE>.
See also <CODE>fetch-glue</CODE> above.

<DT><CODE>rfc2308-type1</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE>, the server will send NS records along with the SOA
record for negative answers from the cache.
You need to set this to <CODE>no</CODE> if you have an old BIND
server using you as a forwarder that does not understand negative answers
which contain both SOA and NS records or you have an old version of sendmail.
The correct fix is to upgrade the broken server or sendmail.
The default is <CODE>no</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>use-id-pool</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE>, the server will keep track of its own outstanding
query ID's to avoid duplication and increase randomness.  This will result
in 128KB more memory being consumed by the server.
The default is <CODE>no</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>treat-cr-as-space</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>yes</CODE>, the server will treat '\r' characters the same way it 
treats a ' ' or '\t'.  This may be necessary when loading zone files on a 
UNIX system that were generated on an NT or DOS machine.  The default is <CODE>no</CODE>.

</DL>

<A NAME="Also-notify"><H4>Also-Notify</H4></A>

<DT><CODE>also-notify</CODE>
<P>
Defines a global list of IP addresses that also get sent NOTIFY messages
whenever a fresh copy of the zone is loaded. This helps to ensure that
copies of the zones will quickly converge on ``stealth'' servers.
If an <CODE>also-notify</CODE> list is given in a <CODE>zone</CODE>
statement, it will override the <CODE>options also-notify</CODE> statement.
When a <CODE>zone notify</CODE> statement is set to <CODE>no</CODE>, 
the IP addresses in the global <CODE>also-notify</CODE> list will not get
sent NOTIFY messages for that zone.
The default is the empty list (no global notification list).

<A NAME="Forwarding"><H4>Forwarding</H4></A>

<P>The forwarding facility can be used to create a large site-wide
cache on a few servers, reducing traffic over links to external
nameservers.  It can also be used to allow queries by servers that do
not have direct access to the Internet, but wish to look up exterior
names anyway.  Forwarding occurs only on those queries for which the
server is not authoritative and does not have the answer in its cache.

<DL>
<DT><CODE>forward</CODE>
<DD>
This option is only meaningful if the <CODE>forwarders</CODE> list is
not empty.  A value of <CODE>first</CODE>, the default, causes the
server to query the forwarders first, and if that doesn't answer the
question the server will then look for the answer itself.  If
<CODE>only</CODE> is specified, the server will only query the
forwarders. 

<DT><CODE>forwarders</CODE>
<DD>
Specifies the IP addresses to be used for forwarding.  The default is the
empty list (no forwarding).
</DL>

<P>Forwarding can also be configured on a per-zone basis, allowing for
the global forwarding options to be overridden in a variety of ways.
You can set particular zones to use different forwarders, or have
different <CODE>forward only/first</CODE> behavior, or to not forward
at all.  See the <A HREF="zone.html"><CODE>zone</CODE></A> statement
for more information.

<P>Future versions of BIND 8 will provide a more powerful forwarding
system.  The syntax described above will continue to be supported.

<a name="NameChecking"><H4>Name Checking</H4></a>

<P>The server can check domain names based upon their expected client contexts.
For example, a domain name used as a hostname can be checked for compliance
with the RFCs defining valid hostnames.

<P>Three checking methods are available:

<DL>
<DT><CODE>ignore</CODE>
<DD>
No checking is done.

<DT><CODE>warn</CODE>
<DD>
Names are checked against their expected client contexts.  Invalid names are
logged, but processing continues normally.

<DT><CODE>fail</CODE>
<DD>
Names are checked against their expected client contexts.  Invalid names are
logged, and the offending data is rejected.
</DL>

<P>The server can check names three areas: master zone files, slave
zone files, and in responses to queries the server has initiated.  If
<CODE>check-names response fail</CODE> has been specified, and
answering the client's question would require sending an invalid name
to the client, the server will send a REFUSED response code to the
client.

<P>The defaults are:

<PRE>
    check-names master fail;
    check-names slave warn;
    check-names response ignore;
</PRE>

<P><CODE>check-names</CODE> may also be specified in the
<A HREF="zone.html"><CODE>zone</CODE></A>
statement, in which case it overrides the <CODE>options check-names</CODE>
statement.  When used in a <CODE>zone</CODE> statement, the area is not
specified (because it can be deduced from the zone type).

<A name="AccessControl"><H4>Access Control</H4></A>

<P>Access to the server can be restricted based on the IP address of the
requesting system.  See
<VAR><A HREF="address_list.html">address_match_list</A></VAR> for details
on how to specify IP address lists.

<DL>
<DT><CODE>allow-query</CODE>
<DD>
Specifies which hosts are allowed to ask ordinary questions.
<CODE>allow-query</CODE> may also be specified in the
<CODE>zone</CODE> statement, in which case it overrides the
<CODE>options allow-query</CODE> statement.  If not specified, the default is
to allow queries from all hosts.

<DT><CODE>allow-transfer</CODE>
<DD>
Specifies which hosts are allowed to receive zone transfers from the
server.  <CODE>allow-transfer</CODE> may also be specified in the
<CODE>zone</CODE> statement, in which case it overrides the
<CODE>options allow-transfer</CODE> statement.  If not specified, the default
is to allow transfers from all hosts.

<DT><CODE>allow-recursion</CODE>
<DD>
Specifies which hosts are allowed to make recursive queries through this
server.  If not specified, the default is to allow recursive queries from 
all hosts.

<DT><CODE>blackhole</CODE>
<DD>
Specifies a list of addresses that the server will not accept queries from
or use to resolve a query.  Queries from these addresses will not be
responded to.
</DL>

<H4>Interfaces</H4>

<P>The interfaces and ports that the server will answer queries from may
be specified using the <CODE>listen-on</CODE> option.  <CODE>listen-on</CODE>
takes an optional port, and an 
<VAR><A HREF="address_list.html">address_match_list</A></VAR>.  The server will
listen on all interfaces allowed by the address match list.  If a port is
not specified, port 53 will be used.

<P>Multiple <CODE>listen-on</CODE> statements are allowed.  For example,

<PRE>
    listen-on { 5.6.7.8; };
    listen-on port 1234 { !1.2.3.4; 1.2/16; };
</PRE>

will enable the nameserver on port 53 for the IP address 5.6.7.8, and
on port 1234 of an address on the machine in net 1.2 that is not
1.2.3.4.

<P>If no <CODE>listen-on</CODE> is specified, the server will listen on port
53 on all interfaces.

<H4>Query Address</H4>

<P>If the server doesn't know the answer to a question, it will query
other nameservers.  <CODE>query-source</CODE> specifies the address
and port used for such queries.  If <CODE>address</CODE> is
<CODE>*</CODE> or is omitted, a wildcard IP address
(<CODE>INADDR_ANY</CODE>) will be used.  If <CODE>port</CODE> is
<CODE>*</CODE> or is omitted, a random unprivileged port will be used.
The default is

<PRE>
    query-source address * port *;
</PRE>

<P>Note: <CODE>query-source port</CODE> applies only to UDP queries,
TCP queries always use a random unprivileged port.

<A name="ZoneTransfers"><H4>Zone Transfers</H4></A>

<DL>
<DT><CODE>max-transfer-time-in</CODE>
<DD>
Inbound zone transfers (<CODE>named-xfer</CODE> processes) running
longer than this many minutes will be terminated.  The default is 120
minutes (2 hours).

<DT><CODE>transfer-format</CODE>
<DD>
The server supports two zone transfer methods.
<CODE>one-answer</CODE> uses one DNS message per resource record
transferred.  <CODE>many-answers</CODE> packs as many resource records
as possible into a message.  <CODE>many-answers</CODE> is more
efficient, but is only known to be understood by BIND 8.1+ and patched
versions of BIND 4.9.5.  The default is <CODE>one-answer</CODE>.
<CODE>transfer-format</CODE> may be
overridden on a per-server basis by using the <CODE>server</CODE> statement.

<DT><CODE>transfers-in</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum number of inbound zone transfers that can be running
concurrently.  The default value is 10.  Increasing
<CODE>transfers-in</CODE> may speed up the convergence of slave zones,
but it also may increase the load on the local system.

<DT><CODE>transfers-out</CODE>
<DD>
This option will be used in the future to limit the number of
concurrent outbound zone transfers.  It is checked for syntax, but is
otherwise ignored.

<DT><CODE>transfers-per-ns</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum number of inbound zone transfers (<CODE>named-xfer</CODE>
processes) that can be concurrently transferring from a given remote
nameserver.  The default value is 2.  Increasing
<CODE>transfers-per-ns</CODE> may speed up the convergence of slave
zones, but it also may increase the load on the remote nameserver.
<CODE>transfers-per-ns</CODE> may be overridden on a per-server basis
by using the <CODE>transfers</CODE> phrase of the <CODE>server</CODE>
statement.

<DT><CODE>transfer-source</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>transfer-source</CODE> determines which local address will be bound
to the TCP connection used to fetch all zones transferred inbound by the
server. If not set, it defaults to a system controlled value which will
usually be the address of the interface ``closest to'' the remote end.
This address must appear in the remote end's <CODE>allow-transfer</CODE>
option for the zone being transferred, if one is specified. This statement
sets the <CODE>transfer-source</CODE> for all zones, but can be overridden
on a per-zone basis by including a <CODE>transfer-source</CODE> statement
within the zone block in the configuration file.

<DT><CODE>serial-queries</CODE>
<DD>
Slave servers will periodically query master servers to find out if zone
serial numbers have changed.  Each such query uses a minute amount of the
slave server's network bandwidth, but more importantly each query uses a
small amount of <I>memory</I> in the slave server while waiting for the 
master server to respond.  The <CODE>serial-queries</CODE> option sets the
maximum number of concurrent serial-number queries allowed to be outstanding
at any given time.  The default is four (4).
<B>Note:</B>
If a server loads a large (tens or hundreds of thousands) number of slave
zones, this limit should be raised to the high hundreds or low
thousands -- otherwise the slave server may never actually become aware of
zone changes in the master servers.  Beware, though, that setting this limit
arbitrarily high can spend a considerable amount of your slave server's
network, CPU, and memory resources.  As with all tunable limits, this one
should be changed gently and monitored for its effects.
</DL>

<H4>Resource Limits</H4>

<P>The server's usage of many system resources can be limited.  Some
operating systems don't support some of the limits.  On such systems,
a warning will be issued if the unsupported limit is used.  Some
operating systems don't support limiting resources, and on these systems
a <CODE>cannot set resource limits on this system</CODE> message will
be logged.

<P>Scaled values are allowed when specifying resource limits.  For
example, <CODE>1G</CODE> can be used instead of
<CODE>1073741824</CODE> to specify a limit of one gigabyte.
<CODE>unlimited</CODE> requests unlimited use, or the maximum
available amount.  <CODE>default</CODE> uses the limit that was in
force when the server was started.  See
<VAR><A HREF="docdef.html">size_spec</A></VAR> for more details.

<DL>
<DT><CODE>coresize</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum size of a core dump.  The default is <CODE>default</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>datasize</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum amount of data memory the server may use.  The default is
<CODE>default</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>files</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum number of files the server may have open concurrently.
The default is <CODE>unlimited</CODE>.  <I>Note:</I> on some operating
systems the server cannot set an unlimited value and cannot determine
the maximum number of open files the kernel can support.  On such
systems, choosing <CODE>unlimited</CODE> will cause the server to use
the larger of the <CODE>rlim_max</CODE> for <CODE>RLIMIT_NOFILE</CODE>
and the value returned by <CODE>sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX)</CODE>.  If the
actual kernel limit is larger than this value, use <CODE>limit
files</CODE> to specify the limit explicitly.

<DT><CODE>max-ixfr-log-size</CODE>
<DD>
Limit the size of the transaction log kept for Incremental Zone Transfer. 
Default 0 (unlimited).

<DT><CODE>stacksize</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum amount of stack memory the server may use.  The default is
<CODE>default</CODE>.
</DL>

<H4>Periodic Task Intervals</H4>

<DL>
<DT><CODE>cleaning-interval</CODE>
<DD>
The server will remove expired resource records from the cache every
<CODE>cleaning-interval</CODE> minutes.  The default is 60 minutes.  If set
to 0, no periodic cleaning will occur.

<DT><CODE>heartbeat-interval</CODE>
<DD>
The server will perform zone maintenance tasks for all zones marked
<CODE>dialup yes</CODE> whenever this interval expires.
The default is 60 minutes.  Reasonable values are up to 1 day (1440 minutes).
If set to 0, no zone maintenance for these zones will occur.
<DT><CODE>interface-interval</CODE>
<DD>
The server will scan the network interface list every
<CODE>interface-interval</CODE> minutes.  The default is 60 minutes.
If set to 0, interface scanning will only occur when the configuration
file is loaded.  After the scan, listeners will be started on any new
interfaces (provided they are allowed by the <CODE>listen-on</CODE>
configuration).  Listeners on interfaces that have gone away will be
cleaned up.

<DT><CODE>statistics-interval</CODE>
<DD>
Nameserver statistics will be logged every <CODE>statistics-interval</CODE>
minutes.  The default is 60.  If set to 0, no statistics will be logged.
</DL>

<H4><A NAME="topology">Topology</A></H4>

<P>All other things being equal, when the server chooses a nameserver
to query from a list of nameservers, it prefers the one that is
topologically closest to itself.  The <CODE>topology</CODE> statement
takes an <VAR><A HREF="address_list.html">address_match_list</A></VAR>
and interprets it in a special way.  Each top-level list element is
assigned a distance.  Non-negated elements get a distance based on
their position in the list, where the closer the match is to the start
of the list, the shorter the distance is between it and the server.  A
negated match will be assigned the maximum distance from the server.
If there is no match, the address will get a distance which is further
than any non-negated list element, and closer than any negated
element.  For example,

<PRE>
    topology {
        10/8;
        !1.2.3/24;
        { 1.2/16; 3/8; };
    };
</PRE>

<P>will prefer servers on network 10 the most, followed by hosts on
network 1.2.0.0 (netmask 255.255.0.0) and network 3, with the exception
of hosts on network 1.2.3 (netmask 255.255.255.0), which is preferred least
of all.

<P>The default topology is

<PRE>
    topology { localhost; localnets; };
</PRE>

<H4><A NAME="sortlist">Resource Record sorting</A></H4>

<P>
When returning multiple RRs,
the nameserver will normally return them in
<B>Round Robin</B>,
i.e. after each request, the first RR is put to the end of the list.
As the order of RRs is not defined, this should not cause any problems.
</P>
<P>
The client resolver code should re-arrange the RRs as appropriate,
i.e. using any addresses on the local net in preference to other addresses.
However, not all resolvers can do this, or are not correctly configured.
</P>
<P>
When a client is using a local server, the sorting can be performed in the
server, based on the client's address.
This only requires configuring the nameservers, not all the clients.
</P>
<P>
The sortlist statement takes an address match list and interprets it even
more specially than the <A HREF="#topology">topology</A> statement does.
</P>
<P>
Each top level statement in the sortlist must itself be an explicit
address match list with one or two elements.  The first element
(which may be an IP address, an IP prefix, an ACL name or nested
address match list) of each top level list is checked against the
source address of the query until a match is found.
</P>
<P>
Once the source address of the query has been matched, if the top level
statement contains only one element, the actual primitive element that
matched the source address is used to select the address in the response
to move to the beginning of the response.  If the statement is a list
of two elements, the second element is treated like the address
match list in a topology statement.  Each top level element is assigned
a distance and the address in the response with the minimum distance is
moved to the beginning of the response.
</P>
<P>
In the following example, any queries received from any of the addresses
of the host itself will get responses preferring addresses on any of
the locally connected networks.  Next most preferred are addresses on
the 192.168.1/24 network, and after that either the 192.168.2/24 or
192.168.3/24 network with no preference shown between these two networks.
Queries received from a host on the 192.168.1/24 network will prefer
other addresses on that network to the 192.168.2/24 and 192.168.3/24
networks.  Queries received from a host on the 192.168.4/24 or the
192.168.5/24 network will only prefer other addresses on their
directly connected networks.
<PRE>
sortlist {
           { localhost;         // IF   the local host
             { localnets;       // THEN first fit on the
               192.168.1/24;    //      following nets
               { 192,168.2/24; 192.168.3/24; }; }; };
           { 192.168.1/24;      // IF   on class C 192.168.1
             { 192.168.1/24;    // THEN use .1, or .2 or .3
               { 192.168.2/24; 192.168.3/24; }; }; };
           { 192.168.2/24;      // IF   on class C 192.168.2
             { 192.168.2/24;    // THEN use .2, or .1 or .3
               { 192.168.1/24; 192.168.3/24; }; }; };
           { 192.168.3/24;      // IF   on class C 192.168.3
             { 192.168.3/24;    // THEN use .3, or .1 or .2
               { 192.168.1/24; 192.168.2/24; }; }; };
           { { 192.168.4/24; 192.168.5/24; }; // if .4 or .5, prefer that net
           };
};
</PRE>
The following example will give reasonable behaviour for the local host
and hosts on directly connected networks.  It is similar to the behavior
of the address sort in BIND 4.9.x.  Responses sent to queries from the
local host will favor any of the directly connected networks.  Responses
sent to queries from any other hosts on a directly connected network will
prefer addresses on that same network.  Responses to other queries will
not be sorted.
<PRE>
sortlist {
            { localhost; localnets; };
            { localnets; };
};
</PRE>
<!--
 * XXX - it would be nice to have an ACL called "source" that matched the
 *       source address of a query so that a host could be configured to
 *       automatically prefer itself, and an ACL called "sourcenet", that
 *       would return the primitive IP match element that matched the source
 *       address so that you could do:
 *          { localnets; { sourcenet; { other stuff ...}; };
 *       and automatically get similar behaviour to what you get with:
 *          { localnets; };

<a name="RrsetOrder">
<H4>RRset Ordering</H4>

<P>When multiple records are returned in an answer it may be useful to
configure the order the records are placed into the response. For example the
records for a zone might be configured to always be returned in the order they
are defined in the zone file.  Or perhaps a <i>random</i> shuffle of the
records as they are returned is wanted. The <var>rrset-order</var> statement
permits configuration of the ordering made of the records in a multiple record
response. The default, if no ordering is defined, is a cyclic ordering (round
robin).

<P>An <var>order_spec</var> is defined as follows:

<PRE>
  [ <var>class</var> class_name ][ <var>type</var> type_name ][ <var>name</var> "FQDN" ] <var>order</var> ordering
</PRE>

<P>If no <var>class</var> is specified, the default is <code>ANY</code>. If no
<var>type</var> is specified, the default is <code>ANY</code>. If no
<var>name</var> is specified, the default is <code>"*"</code>. 

<P>The legal values for <code>ordering</code> are:

<DL>
<DT><code>fixed</code>
<DD>Records are returned in the order they are defined in the zone file.

<DT><code>random</code>
<DD>Records are returned in some random order.

<DT><code>cyclic</code>
<DD>Records are returned in a round-robin order.

</DL>


<P>For example:

<PRE>
    rrset-order {
	class IN type A name "rc.vix.com" order random;
        order cyclic;
    };
</PRE>

<P>will cause any responses for type <VAR>A</VAR> records in class
<VAR>IN</VAR> that have "rc.vix.com" as a suffix, to always be returned in
random order. All other records are returned in cyclic order.

<P>If multiple <code>rrset-order</code> statements appear, they are not
combined--the last one applies.

<P>If no <code>rrset-order</code> statement is specified, a default one
of:

<pre>
    rrset-order { class ANY type ANY name "*" order cyclic ; };
</pre>

<P>is used.

<H4>Glue Ordering</H4>

When running a root nameserver it is sometimes necessary to ensure that
other nameservers that are priming are successful.  This requires
that glue A records for at least of the nameservers are returned in
the answer to a priming query.  This can be achieved by setting
<CODE>preferred-glue A;</CODE> which will add A records before other types
in the additional section.

<H4>EDNS</H4>

Some firewalls fail to pass EDNS/UDP messages that are larger than
certain size, 512 or the UDP reassembly buffer.  To allow EDNS to
work across such firewalls it is necessary to advertise a EDNS
buffer size that is small enough to not trigger failures.
<CODE>edns-udp-size</CODE> can be use to adjust the advertised size.
Values less than 512 will be increased to 512 and values greater than
4096 will be truncated to 4096.

<H4>Tuning</H4>

<DL>
<DT><CODE>lame-ttl</CODE>
<DD>
Sets the number of seconds to cache a lame server indication.
0 disables caching.  Default is 600 (10 minutes).  Maximum value is 1800 (30 minutes).
<DT><CODE>max-ncache-ttl</CODE>
<DD>
To reduce network traffic and increase performance the server stores negative
answers.  <CODE>max-ncache-ttl</CODE> is used to set a maximum retention time
for these answers in the server is seconds.  The default <CODE>max-ncache-ttl</CODE> is
10800 seconds (3 hours).  <CODE>max-ncache-ttl</CODE> cannot exceed the
maximum retention time for ordinary (positive) answers (7 days) and will be
silently truncated to 7 days if set to a value which is greater that 7 days.
<DT><CODE>min-roots</CODE>
<DD>
The minimum number of root servers that is required for a
request for the root servers to be accepted.  Default 2.
