this is a utility used to build prand_conf.h on new ports.

To run you can either compile the program prand_conf.c with 
cc prand_conf.c -o prand_conf		# add -posix on NeXTstep systems
./prand_conf 

both programs create a file prand_conf.h,
copy this file to the appropriate port/<os>/include directory
