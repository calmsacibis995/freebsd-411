DNSSEC Notes:

This file contains description of two interoperabilty problems related
to DNSSEC that only affect sites using DNSSEC.

1. All versions of bind-8 older than 8.2.2 

Between versions 8.2.1 and 8.2.2 the printed format of SIG records
changed. As a result, using a signer, named and named-xfer of
differrent versions will cause parsing errors on signed zonefiles.
Included is an AWK program that converts old signed zone files to new 
new format, see contrib/dns_signer/add_labels.awk 
Usage: awk -f <path>/contrib/dns_signer/add_labels.awk <signed_zone >fixed_zone

2. BIND-8.1 BIND-8.1.1 BIND-8.1.2 Interoperability

If you wish to use BIND-8.1.x as a master server (either primary or
secondary) for DNSSEC signed zone you MUST apply the following patch
to the file src/bin/named/db_load.c. It fixes a bug that rejects
valid RSA signatures on load. 
You can patch the file by running following command from this directory 
	patch -d bin/named   <DNSSEC
