Release 1.1.5
-------------

***NEW***

Added James Ramsey's CHAPTER_TITLE macro as well as control macros to
go with it.  Thanks James.  Also from James came a patch to handle
START differenty which has been incorporated into om.tmac.  Thanks
again, James.

Some bits and pieces of the docs have been tweaked, but nothing
changed.  Hopefully, the changes will make parts of the docs easier to
read and navigate.

***FIXES***

o \*[RULE]

o broken draft and revision in docheaders

o post-epigraph spacing in TYPEWRITE

o header spacing in TYPEWRITE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.1.4
-------------

***SIGNIFICANT CHANGE***
.IX is now deprecated, although it will continue to work as before.
The new form is .IQ (Indent Quit).  Groff will emit a message advising
users to update their docs.

***NEW***
Four new inlines to deal with horizontal and vertical movements:

    o \*[FWD n]
    o \*[BCK n]
    o \*[UP n]
    o \*[DOWN n]

All four require a unit of measure after n.  These inlines are similar
to the older \*[FPn], \*[BPn], \*[ALDn] and \*[RLDn], however they're
not restricted to points, and any value can be entered for n (the older
forms -- which still work -- were restricted to 1 - 36).

***CHANGED***
Inline kerning can now be accomplished with \*[BU n] and \*[FU n], where
n, after the space, is the desired number of kern units.  The older
forms \*[BUn] and \*[FUn] still work, up to 36 units.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.1.3c
--------------

***NEW***
A new macro -- ENDNOTES_HDRFTR_CENTER -- added so that mom's default
behaviour of not printing the header center string when DOCTYPE is
CHAPTER can be disabled (i.e. she will print the center string).  The
macro is user-called with ENDNOTES_HEADER_CENTER or
ENDNOTES_FOOTER_CENTER.

***FIXES***
PAD now works as advertised when fill mode is on.

ENDNOTES no longer disables printing of footnotes on last page of
document body.

Release 1.1.3
-------------

***SIGNIFICANT CHANGE -- PLEASE TAKE NOTE***
As of 1.1.3, groff must be >= 1.18.

***NEW***
Added endnotes functionality to mom, along with a slew of macros to
control how mom prints endnotes pages.  See the html documentation.

***NEW***
Added inline \*[RULE], which draws a rule to the full measure of the
current line length ( to be used in place of \h'\n(.lu' ).  Weight of the
rule is dependent on the point size of type when \#[RULE] is called.

***FIXES***
PAD -- works more intuitively now when the pad string contains inline
escapes for font, point size, etc.

UNDERLINE -- fixed character translations of digraphs so they get
underlined properly.  Also fixed a bug that was causing some footnotes
to get underlined when UNDERLINE was on in the body of the document.

***UPDATES***
Html documentation
elvis_syn

Release 1.1.2a
--------------

***SIGNIFICANT CHANGE -- PLEASE TAKE NOTE***
In order to help mom toward full groffship, the macro .PS has been
renamed to .PT_SIZE, and the alias .TS (for .TAB_SET) has been removed.
.PS and .TS are keywords used by pic and tbl respectively, and the mom
macros of the same name were in conflict.

Release 1.1.2
-------------

***IT'S OFFICIAL!***
mom is now an official part of the groff.  New releases will be
incorporated into the groff package.  I'll still be posting each new
release on the mom homepage, so there's no need to download all of the
most recent version of groff just to get a newer mom. :)

***CHANGES***
Fixed default footer separator rule adjustment so that it's closer to
the advertised "4 points above the tallest ascender in the footer."

Added more stuff to the elvis_syn file.  Still wouldn't mind someone
contributing some vim/emacs syntax highlighting.

Added .cflags 4 /\(em to om.tmac.  By default, mom now obligingly
breaks after / and \(en.

***NEW***
Macro(s): HEADER_RECTO
          HEADER_VERSO
With these macros, users can now define single-string recto/verso
headers/footers.  HEADER_RECTO (or FOOTER_RECTO) can be used to create
a one-part header/footer (instead of mom's default three-parters) that
appears on every page if RECTO_VERSO is OFF or, if RECTO_VERSO is on, if
no HEADER_VERSO (or FOOTER_VERSO) has been defined.  If a HEADER_VERSO
(or FOOTER_VERSO) is defined and RECTO_VERSO is on, _RECTO prints on
even pages and _VERSO on odd pages.

Added macro DRAFT_WITH_PAGENUMBER so user can have draft/revision
info attached to the pagenumber in COPYSTYLE DRAFT, instead of having
it HEADER center.  Always having it HEADER center was creating problems
with long doc titles, esp. with PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE (which is when
COPYSTYLE DRAFT is most likely to be used).

***FIXES***
No more "can't break line" warnings in DOCTYPE LETTER.

If no REVISION number is given, Rev. 0 no longer appears HEADER_CENTER
in COPYSTYLE DRAFT

PAGENUM_STYLE now works as advertised.

Release 1.1.1
-------------

***CHANGES***
Main macro file renamed to om.tmac, in keeping with current groff
policy.

Now okay to use groff mailing list for mom-related posts

***NEW***
Toggle macro -- BR_AT_LINE_KERN.  When on, automatically deposits
a break whenever .RW or .EW are invoked.  Very useful when kerning
whole lines of rag copy.

***NEW***
Toggle macro -- PAGENUM_ON_FIRST_PAGE.  Normally, when FOOTERS are
being used instead of HEADERS, mom doesn't print the page number at
the top of the first page of a doc, or the first page of collated docs.
PAGENUM_ON_FIRST_PAGE allows user to get mom to put the page number on
"first" pages if that's desired.

***NEW***
Macro -- BREAK_QUOTE -- to deal with problem of footnoted quotes and
blockquotes that cross a page or column.

***NEW***
New argument to AUTOLEAD -- FACTOR.  With FACTOR, you can, if you
wish, enter a factor by which AUTOLEAD multiplies the point size when
calculating lead automatically.

Improvements
------------

PAPER now has a much larger selection of common paper sizes.

\*[ALD], \*[RLD], \*[FP] and \*[BP] now accept increments of quarter
points (expressed as decimal fractions).  \*[RLD1.75], for example,
reverses 1-3/4 points up on the line.

HEADER_SIZE now available to PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE.  This was necessary
to deal with the problem of excessively long HEADER_LEFT, _CENTER or
_RIGHT strings.

Fixes
-----

T_MARGIN -- can be set before or after LS or AUTOLEAD
SS       -- remains constant regardless of WS
WS       -- no longer affects SS
TI       -- now works as expected even when called while another indent
            type is in effect
COLLATE  -- small fixes

Broken .RW and .EW fixed.

String tabs now behave properly when set from within tabs.

UNDERLINE_QUOTES (for PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE) are now, in fact, on by
default as the docs state.
