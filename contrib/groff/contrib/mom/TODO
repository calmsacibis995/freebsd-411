CONTROL MACROS -- _INDENT
--------------
Let user be able to enter decimal fractions as the argument to _INDENT
control macros, or, instead, let user be able to enter absolute
values with a unit of measure in addition to current behaviour,
which is relative.

LISTS
-----
Possbility of indented, nested lists, html-style.  Options for numbered,
alpha-ed, bulleted, dashed.  Again, not sure how useful these would be
for mom's target users.  As things stand now, it's easy enough to
set up lists with string tabs or hanging indents.

BIBLIOGRAPHY
------------
Thinking about macros to *assist* in user-written bibliographies (i.e.
not biblios that get generated automatically at the ends of docs).  Style
considerations are a nightmare, though.
