<h2><a name="INTRO_MACROS_TYPESETTING"><u>Introduction to the typesetting macros</u></a></h2>

<strong>Mom</strong>'s typesetting macros provide access to
groff's typesetting capabilities.  Aside from controlling basic
type parameters (family, font, line length, point size, leading),
<strong>mom</strong>'s macros fine-tune wordspacing, letterspacing,
kerning, hyphenation, and so on.  In addition, <strong>mom</strong>
has true typesetting tabs, string tabs, multiple indent styles,
line padding, and a batch of other goodies.
<p>
In some cases, <strong>mom</strong>'s typesetting macros merely imitate
groff primitives.  In others, they approach typesetting concerns in
conceptually new ways (for groff, at least).  This should present no
problem for newcomers to groff who are learning <strong>mom</strong>.
Old groff hands should be careful.  Just because it looks like a
duck and walks like a duck does not, in this instance, mean that it
is a duck.  When using <strong>mom</strong>, stay away from groff
primitives if <strong>mom</strong> provides a macro that accomplishes
the same thing.
<p>
<strong>Mom</strong>'s typesetting macros can be used as a standalone
package, independent of the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>.
With them, you can typeset on-the-fly.  Document covers, your best
friend's résumé, a poster for a lost dog -- none of these requires
structured document processing (page headers, paragraphs, heads,
footnotes, etc).  What they do demand is precise control over every
element on the page.  The typesetting macros give you that control.

<a name="PAGE_MARGINS">
	<h2><u>Page setup: paper size and page margins</u></h2>
</a>

The page setup macros establish the physical dimensions of your
page and the margins you want it to have.  <strong>Groff</strong>
has defaults for these, but I recommend setting them at the top
of your files anyway unless you're using <strong>mom</strong>'s
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>
and are content with her defaults.
<p>
The
<a href="#PAPER">PAPER</a>
macro provides a shortcut for setting the page to the correct dimensions
for a number of well-known, established paper sizes.  The
<a href="#PAGE">PAGE</a>
macro provides a convenient way of setting the page dimensions and
some or all of the page margins with a single macro.
<br>

<!---PAGEWIDTH--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="PAGEWIDTH"><h3><u>Page width</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>PAGEWIDTH</strong> <var>&lt;width of printer sheet&gt;</var>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
The argument to <strong>PAGEWIDTH</strong> is the width of your
printer sheet.  <strong>PAGEWIDTH</strong> requires a unit of measure.
Decimal fractions are allowed.  Hence, to tell <strong>mom</strong>
the width of your printer sheet is 8-1/2 inches, you enter
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGEWIDTH 8.5i
</pre>

<!---PAGELENGTH--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="PAGELENGTH"><h3><u>Page length</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>PAGELENGTH</strong> <var>&lt;length of printer sheet&gt;</var>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>PAGELENGTH</strong> tells <strong>mom</strong> how long your
printer sheet is.  It works just like
<strong>PAGEWIDTH</strong>.  Therefore, to tell
<strong>mom</strong> your printer sheet is 11 inches long, you
enter
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGELENGTH 11i
</pre>

<!---PAPER--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="PAPER"><h3><u>Paper</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>PAPER</strong> <var>&lt;paper type&gt;</var>

<p>
<strong>PAPER</strong> provides a convenient way to set the page
dimensions for some common printer sheet sizes.  <var>&lt;paper
type&gt;</var> can be one of:
<p>
<pre>
	LETTER
	LEGAL
	STATEMENT
	TABLOID
	LEDGER
	FOLIO
	QUARTO
	10x14
	EXECUTIVE
	A3
	A4
	A5
	B4
	B5 
</pre>

Say, for example, you have A4-sized sheets in your printer.
It's shorter (and easier) to enter
<p>
<pre>
	.PAPER A4
</pre>

than to remember the correct dimensions and enter
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGEWIDTH  595p
	.PAGELENGTH 842p
</pre>

<!---L_MARGIN--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="L_MARGIN"><h3><u>Left margin</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>L_MARGIN</strong> <var>&lt;left margin&gt;</var>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>L_MARGIN</strong> establishes the distance from the left edge
of the printer sheet at which you want your type to start.  It may
be used any time, and remains in effect until you enter a new value.
<p>
<a href="#IL">Left indents</a>
and
<a href="#TABS">tabs</a>
are calculated from the value you pass to <strong>L_MARGIN</strong>,
hence it's always a good idea to invoke it before starting any serious
typesetting.  A unit of measure is required.  Decimal fractions are
allowed.  Therefore, to set the left margin at 3 picas (1/2 inch),
you'd enter either
<p>
<pre>
	.L_MARGIN 3P
	&nbsp;&nbsp;or
	.L_MARGIN .5i
</pre>

If you use the macros
<a href="#PAGE">PAGE</a>,
<a href="#PAGEWIDTH">PAGEWIDTH</a>
or
<a href="#PAPER">PAPER</a>
without invoking <strong>L_MARGIN</strong> (either before
or afterwards), <strong>mom</strong> automatically sets
</strong>L_MARGIN</strong> to 1 inch.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> L_MARGIN behaves in a special way when you're
using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>.
See
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TYPESETTING">Typesetting Macros in Document Processing</a>
for an explanation.
<br>

<!---R_MARGIN--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="R_MARGIN"><h3><u>Right margin</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>R_MARGIN</strong> <var>&lt;right margin&gt;</var>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>R_MARGIN</strong> establishes the amount of space you
want between the end of typeset lines and the right hand edge
of the printer sheet.  In other words, it sets the line length.
<strong>R_MARGIN</strong> requires a unit of measure.  Decimal
fractions are allowed.
<p>
The <a href="#LINELENGTH">line length macro</a> (<strong>LL</strong>) can
be used in place of <strong>R_MARGIN</strong>.  In either case, the
last one invoked sets the line length.  The choice of which to use is
up to you.  In some instances, you may find it easier to think of a
section of type as having a right margin.  In others, giving a line
length may make more sense.
<p>
For example, if you're setting a page of type you know should have
6-pica margins left and right, it makes sense to enter a left and
right margin, like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.L_MARGIN 6P
	.R_MARGIN 6P
</pre>

That way, you don't have to worry about calculating the line
length.  On the other hand, if you know the line length for a
patch of type should be 17 picas and 3 points, entering the line
length with <strong>LL</strong> is much easier than calculating the
right margin.
<p>
<pre>
	.LL 17P+3p
</pre>

If you use the macros
<a href="#PAGE">PAGE</a>,
<a href="#PAGEWIDTH">PAGEWIDTH</a>
or
<a href="#PAPER">PAPER</a>
without invoking <strong>R_MARGIN</strong> afterwards,
<strong>mom</strong> automatically sets <strong>R_MARGIN</strong>
to 1 inch.  If you set a line length after these macros (with
<a href="#LINELENGTH">LL</a>),
the line length calculated by <strong>R_MARGIN</strong> is, of course,
overridden.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT: R_MARGIN</strong>, if used, MUST come after
<a href="#PAPER">PAPER</a>,
<a href="#PAGEWIDTH">PAGEWIDTH</a>,
<a href="#L_MARGIN">L_MARGIN</a>
and/or
<a href="#PAGE">PAGE</a>
(if a right margin isn't given to <strong>PAGE</strong>).
The reason is that <strong>R_MARGIN</strong> calculates line
length from the overall page dimensions and the left margin.
Obviously, it can't make the calculation if it doesn't know the page
width and the left margin.
<p>
<strong>NOTE: R_MARGIN</strong> behaves in a special way
when you're using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>.
See
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TYPESETTING">Typesetting Macros in Document Processing</a>
for an explanation.
<br>

<!---T_MARGIN--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="T_MARGIN"><h3><u>Top margin</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>T_MARGIN</strong> <var>&lt;top margin&gt;</var>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>T_MARGIN</strong> establishes the distance from the top of
the printer sheet at which you want your type to start.  It requires
a unit of measure, and decimal fractions are allowed.  To set a top
margin of 2-1/2 centimeters, you'd enter
<p>
<pre>
	.T_MARGIN 2.5c
</pre>

<strong>T_MARGIN</strong> calculates the vertical position of the
first line of type on a page by treating the top edge of the printer
sheet as a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_BASELINE">baseline</a>.  Therefore,
<p>
<pre>
	.T_MARGIN 1.5i
</pre>

puts the baseline of the first line of type 1-1/2 inches beneath
the top of the page.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> <strong>T_MARGIN</strong> does two
things: it establishes the top margin for pages that come after
it AND it moves to that position on the current page.  Therefore,
<strong>T_MARGIN</strong> should only be used at the top of a file
(prior to entering text) or after
<a href="#NEWPAGE">NEWPAGE</a>,
like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.NEWPAGE
	.T_MARGIN 6P
	&lt;text&gt;
</pre>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> <strong>T_MARGIN</strong> means something
slightly different when you're using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>.
See
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TB_MARGINS">Top and bottom margins in document processing</a>
for an explanation.
<br>

<!---B_MARGIN--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="B_MARGIN"><h3><u>Bottom margin</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>B_MARGIN</strong> <var>&lt;bottom margin&gt;</var>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>B_MARGIN</strong> sets a nominal position at the bottom
of the page beyond which you don't want your type to go.  When the
bottom margin is reached, <strong>mom</strong> starts a new page.
<strong>B_MARGIN</strong> requires a unit of measure.  Decimal
fractions are allowed.  To set a nominal bottom margin of 3/4 inch,
enter
<p>
<pre>
	.B_MARGIN .75i
</pre>

Obviously, if you haven't spaced the type on your pages so that
the last lines fall perfectly at the bottom margin, the margin will
vary from page to page.  Usually, but not always, the last line of
type that fits on a page <em>before</em> the bottom margin causes
<strong>mom</strong> to start a new page.
<p>
Occasionally, owing to a peculiarity in <strong>groff</strong>,
an extra line will fall below the nominal bottom margin.  If you're
using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>,
this is unlikely to happen; the document processing macros are very
hard-nosed about aligning bottom margins.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The meaning of <strong>B_MARGIN</strong> is
slightly different when you're using the document processing macros.
See
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TB_MARGINS">Top and bottom margins in document processing</a>
for an explanation.
<br>

<!---PAGE--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="PAGE"><h3><u>Page</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>PAGE</strong>
<var>&lt;width&gt;&nbsp;[ &lt;length&gt; [ &lt;lm&gt; [ &lt;rm&gt; [ &lt;tm&gt; [ &lt;bm&gt; ] ] ] ] ]</var>
<br>
<em>*All arguments require a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>PAGE</strong> lets you establish paper dimensions and page
margins with a single macro.  The only required argument is page width.
The rest are optional, <strong>but they must appear in order and you can't
skip over any.</strong>  <var>&lt;lm&gt;, &lt;rm&gt;, &lt;tm&gt;</var>
and <var>&lt;bm&gt;</var> refer to the left, right, top and bottom
margins respectively.
<p>
Assuming your page dimensions are 11 inches by 17 inches, and that's
all you want to set, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGE 11i 17i
</pre>

If you want to set the left margin as well, say, at 1 inch,
<strong>PAGE</strong> would look like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGE 11i 17i 1i
</pre>

Now suppose you also want to set the top margin, say, at 1-1/2
inches.  <var>&lt;tm&gt;</var> comes after <var>&lt;rm&gt;</var>
in the optional arguments, but you can't skip over any arguments,
therefore to set the top margin, you must also give a right margin.
The <strong>PAGE</strong> macro would look like this:
<p>
<pre>
        .PAGE 11i 17i 1i 1i 1.5i
                         |   |
        required right___|   |___top margin
                margin
</pre>

Clearly, <strong>PAGE</strong> is best used when you want a convenient
way to tell <strong>mom</strong> just the dimensions of your printer
sheet (width and length), or when you want to tell her everything
about the page (dimensions and all the margins), for example
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGE 8.5i 11i 45p 45p 45p 45p
</pre>

This sets up an 8-1/2 by 11 inch page with margins of 45 points
(5/8-inch) all around.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Only use <strong>PAGE</strong> at the
start of a document, before entering any text.  And remember,
when you're using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>,
top margin and bottom margin mean something slightly different than
when you're  using just the typesetting macros (see
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TB_MARGINS">Top and bottom margins in document processing</a>).
<p>
Additionally, if you invoke <strong>PAGE</strong> with a top margin
argument, any macros you invoke after <strong>PAGE</strong> will
almost certainly move the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_BASELINE">baseline</a>
of the first line of text down by one linespace.  To compensate, do
<p>
<pre>
	.RLD 1v
</pre>

immediately before entering any text, or, if it's feasible, make
<strong>PAGE</strong> the last macro you invoke prior to entering text.
<br>

<!---NEWPAGE--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="NEWPAGE"><h3><u>Start a new page</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>NEWPAGE</strong>

<p>
Whenever you want to start a new page, use <strong>NEWPAGE</strong>, by
itself with no argument.  <strong>Mom</strong> will finish up
processing the current page and move you to the top of a new one
(subject to the top margin set with
<a href="#T_MARGIN">T_MARGIN</a>.
<p>
<strong>Experts:</strong> <strong>NEWPAGE</strong> is an alias of
<strong>.bp</strong>.  You can use either, or mix 'n' match with
impunity.

<a name="BASIC_PARAMS">
	<h2><u>Basic Typesetting Parameters</u></h2>
</a>

Basic parameter macros deal with the fundamental requirements
for setting type: family, font, point size, leading and line length.
<p>
If you're using the typesetting macros only, the arguments passed
to the basic parameter macros remain in effect until you change them.
The document processing macros handle things differently.  See
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TYPESETTING">Typesetting Macros in Document Processing</a>
for an explanation.

<!---FAMILY--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="FAMILY"><h3><u>Type family</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>FAMILY</strong> <var>&lt;family&gt;</var>
<br>
Alias: <strong>FAM</strong>

<p>
<strong>FAMILY</strong> takes one argument: the name of the type family
you want.  Groff comes with a number of PostScript families, each
identified by a 1-, 2- or 3-letter mnemonic.  The standard families
are:
<table valign="baseline" summary="family">
<tr><td width="15"><td><strong>A</strong><td>Avant Garde
<tr><td><td><strong>BM</strong> <td>Bookman
<tr><td><td><strong>H</strong><td>Helvetica
<tr><td><td><strong>N</strong><td>New Century Schoolbook
<tr><td><td><strong>P</strong><td>Palatino
<tr><td><td><strong>T</strong><td>Times Roman</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The argument you pass to <strong>FAMILY</strong> is the identifier at
left above.  For example, if you want Helvetica, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.FAMILY H
</pre>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> The <a href="#FONT">font macro</a>
(<strong>FT</strong>) lets you to specify both the type family
and the desired font with a single macro.  While this saves a few
keystrokes, I recommend using <strong>FAMILY</strong> for family,
and <strong>FT</strong> for font, except where doing so is genuinely
inconvenient.
<p>
<strong>Experts:</strong>
<br>
If you add other PostScript families to groff's /font/devps directory,
be sure to follow the groff standard for naming families and fonts.
For example, if you add the Garamond family, name the font files
<p>
<pre>
	GARAMONDR
	GARAMONDI
	GARAMONDB
	GARAMONDBI
</pre>

GARAMOND then becomes a legal family name you can pass to
<strong>FAMILY</strong>.  (You could, of course, shorten GARAMOND to just
G, or GD.)  R, I, B, and BI after GARAMOND are the roman, italic,
bold and bold-italic fonts respectively.
<br>

<!---FT--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="FONT"><h3><u>Font</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>FT</strong> <var>R | I | B | BI</var>

<p>
<strong>FT</strong> takes one of four possible arguments specifying the
desired font:
<table valign="baseline" summary="font">
<tr><td width="15"><td><strong>R</strong><td> = <td>roman
<tr><td><td><strong>I</strong><td> = <td>italic
<tr><td><td><strong>B</strong><td> = <td>bold
<tr><td><td><strong>BI</strong><td> = <td>bold-italic</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
For example, if your family is Helvetica, entering
<p>
<pre>
	.FT B
</pre>

will give you the Helvetica bold font.  If your family were
Palatino, you'd get the Palatino bold font.
<p>
You can specify both family and font in the <strong>FT</strong> macro.
As an example,
<p>
<pre>
	.FT HB
</pre>

sets the font to Helvetica bold.  I strongly recommend keeping
family and font separate.
<p>
Fonts can also be changed inline.  See
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_FONTS_MOM">Inline Escapes, font control</a>.
<br>

<!---PT_SIZE--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="PS"><h3><u>Point size of type</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>PT_SIZE</strong> <var>&lt;size of type in points&gt;</var>
<br>
<em>*Does not require a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>PT_SIZE</strong> (Point Size) takes one argument: the size of type
in points.  Unlike most other macros that establish the size or measure
of something, <strong>PT_SIZE</strong> does not require that you supply a
unit of measure since it's a near universal convention that type size
is measured in points.  Therefore, to change the type size to, say,
11 points, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.PT_SIZE 11
</pre>

Point sizes may be fractional (e.g.  10.25 or 12.5).
<p>
You can prepend a plus or a minus sign to the argument to
<strong>PT_SIZE</strong>, in which case the point size will be changed by +
or - the original value.  For example, if the point size is 12,
and you want 14, you can do
<p>
<pre>
	.PT_SIZE +2
</pre>

then later reset it to 12 with
<p>
<pre>
	.PT_SIZE -2
</pre>

The size of type can also be changed inline.  See
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_SIZE_MOM">Inline Escapes, changing point size</a>.
<br>

<!---LS--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="LEADING"><h3><u>Line spacing/leading</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>LS</strong> <var>&lt;distance between lines&gt;</var>
<br>
<em>*Does not require a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>LS</strong> (Line Space) takes one argument: the distance you want, typically
in points, from baseline to baseline of type.  The argument may
be fractional (e.g. 12.25 or 14.5).  Like <strong>PT_SIZE</strong>,
<strong>LS</strong> does not require a unit of measure, since
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_LEADING">leading</a>
is most often given in points.  Therefore, to set the linespace to
14 points, you would enter
<p>
<pre>
	.LS 14
</pre>

However, if you wish, you may specify a unit of measure by appending
it directly to the argument passed to <strong>LS</strong>.  For example,
if you want a linespace of 1/4 of an inch, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.LS .25i
</pre>

You can prepend a plus or a minus sign to the argument to
<strong>LS</strong>, in which case the line spacing will be changed
by + or - the original value.  For example, if the line spacing is
14 points, and you want 17 points, you can do
<p>
<pre>
	.LS +3
</pre>

then later reset it to 14 points with
<p>
<pre>
	.LS -3
</pre>

<strong>Experts:</strong>
<br>
<strong>LS</strong> should not be confused with the groff primitive
<strong>ls</strong>.  <strong>LS</strong> acts like <strong>vs</strong>.
<strong>mom</strong> does not provide a macro analogous to
<strong>ls</strong>.
<br>

<!---AUTOLEAD--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="AUTOLEAD"><h3><u>Automatic line spacing</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong> <var>&lt;amount of automatic leading&gt; [FACTOR]</var>
<br>
<em>*Does not require a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
Without the <strong>FACTOR</strong> argument, <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong>
calculates the linespace for you by adding its argument to the
current point size of type. All subsequent <strong>PT_SIZE</strong>
requests automatically update the linespacing by the autolead amount.
<p>
Used in this way, <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong> does not require a unit
of measure; points is assumed.  However, you may use an alternate
unit of measure by appending it to the argument.  The argument may
be a decimal fraction (e.g. .5 or 2.75).
<p>
As an example, if your current point size of type is 12, entering
<p>
<pre>
	.AUTOLEAD 2
</pre>

changes the linespace to 14 points, regardless any linespacing
already in effect.  From here on, every change to the size of type
(with <strong>PT_SIZE</strong>, not
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline</a>)
changes the linespace as well.  If you decrease the type size to 9
points, the leading decreases to 11 points.  If you increase the type
size to 16 points, the leading increases to 18 points.
<p>
Automatic updating of the linespacing continues until you enter a
&quot;manual&quot; line space value with <strong>LS</strong>.
<p>
If you give <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong> the optional
<strong>FACTOR</strong> argument, <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong>
calculates the line space as a factor of the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_NUMERICARGUMENT">numeric argument</a>
you gave <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong>.  For example, if your point
size is 12,
<p>
<pre>
	.AUTOLEAD 1.125 FACTOR
</pre>
sets the leading at 13.5 points.  If you change the point size
to 14, the leading automatically changes to 15.75 (14 x 1.125).
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> There's no need to prepend a plus sign (+)
to <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong>'s argument, although you may do so if you
wish.

<!---LL--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="LINELENGTH"><h3><u>Line length</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>LL</strong> <var>&lt;line length&gt;</var>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>LL</strong> (Line Length) takes one argument: the distance from the
left margin of the page to the maximum allowable point on the
right at which groff should place type.  The line length, in
other words, as the macro suggests.
<p>
<strong>LL</strong> requires a unit of measure.  Therefore, to set the line
length to 39 picas, you would enter
<p>
<pre>
	.LL 39P
</pre>

As with other macros that require a unit of measure, the argument to
<strong>LL</strong> may be fractional.  For example,
<p>
<pre>
	.LL 4.5i
</pre>

sets the line length to 4-1/2 inches.

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The <a href="#R_MARGIN">right margin
macro</a> (<strong>R_MARGIN</strong>) can also be used to set line
length.

<p>
<strong>J</strong> and <strong>JUSTIFY</strong> justify text,

&nbsp;&nbsp;Macro: <strong>CENTER</strong>
&nbsp;(alias <strong>CENTRE</strong>)
<br>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_NOFILL"><em>Nofill mode</em></a>

<p>
<strong>LEFT</strong>, <strong>RIGHT</strong> and
<strong>CENTER</strong> let you enter text on a line for line basis
without having to use the
<a href="#BR">BR</a> macro after each line.
Consider the following:
<p>
<pre>
	.QUAD LEFT
	So runs my dream, but what am I?
	.BR
	An infant crying in the night
	.BR
	An infant crying for the light
	.BR
	And with no language but a cry.
	.BR
</pre>

Because text after <strong>QUAD</strong> is
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">filled</a>, you have to use the
<a href="#BR">BR</a>
macro to prevent the lines from running together.  Not only is this
annoying to type, it's awkward to read in a text editor.  Much better
to do
<p>
<pre>
	.LEFT
	So runs my dream, but what am I?
	An infant crying in the night
	An infant crying for the light
	And with no language but a cry.
</pre>

<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Because <strong>LEFT</strong>,
<strong>RIGHT</strong> and <strong>CENTER</strong> are nofill
modes, groff does not always respect the current line length.
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">Input lines</a>
that run long may exceed it, or get broken in undesirable ways.
Therefore, when using these three macros, you should preview your
work to ensure that all lines fit as expected.
<br>

<!---BR--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="BR"><h3><u>Manually break lines</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>BR</strong>

<p>
When using <strong>JUSTIFY</strong> or <strong>QUAD</strong>,
<strong>BR</strong> tells <strong>mom</strong> about partial lines
that you want broken (as opposed to
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">filled</a>).
Any partial
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_OUTPUTLINE">output line</a>
that immediately precedes <strong>BR</strong> will be
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_QUAD">quadded</a>
in the direction of the current quad, or set flush left if text is
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_JUST">justified</a>.

<p>
Most of the time, you won't need the <strong>BR</strong> macro.
In fill modes, <strong>mom</strong> tries to be sensible about
where breaks are needed.  If the nature of a macro is such that under
most circumstances you'd expect a break, <strong>mom</strong> puts
it in herself.  Equally, in macros where a break isn't normally
desirable, no break occurs.  This means text files don't get cluttered
with annoying <strong>BR</strong>'s.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Lines of text in
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_NOFILL">nofill mode</a>
never require a <strong>BR</strong>.  Furthermore, in nofill mode,
ALL macros cause a break.  If a break is not desired, use the
<a href="#JOIN">\c</a>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>.

<p>
<strong>Experts: BR</strong> is an alias for <strong>br</strong>.
You can use either, or mix 'n' match with impunity.
<br>

<!---EL--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="EL"><h3><u>Manually break a line without advancing on the page</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>EL</strong>

<p>
The mnemonic "EL" is borrowed from old Compugraphic typesetting
systems, where it stood for "End Line."  Conceptually,
<strong>EL</strong> is equivalent to the notion of a carriage return
with no linefeed.

<p>
<em>Note to groff jocks:</em> <strong>EL</strong> is
unrelated to groff's <strong>.el</strong>.  If you find the
similarity confusing, you may want to alias <strong>EL</strong> as
<strong>EOL</strong>.

<p>
<strong>EL</strong>'s function is simple: it breaks a line without
advancing on the page.  As an example of where you might use it,
imagine that you're working from marked-up copy.  The markup
indicates 24 points of space between two given lines, but the
prevailing line spacing is 12.5 points.  You may find it more
convenient to break the first line with <strong>EL</strong> and
instruct <strong>mom</strong> to advance 24 points to the next line
instead of calculating the lead that needs to be added to 12.5 to
get 24.  To demonstrate:
<p>
<pre>
	.LS 12.5
	A line of text.
	.EL
	.ALD 24p
	The next line of text.
</pre>

may be more instuitive than
<p>
<pre>
	.LS 12.5
	A line of text.
	.ALD 11.5p
	The next line of text.
</pre>

The first example has the further advantage that should you wish
to change the prevailing line space but keep the 24 points lead,
you don't have to recalculate the extra space.
<p>
"ALD" in the above examples stands for "<strong>A</strong>dvance
<strong>L</strong>ea<strong>D</strong>" (another mnemonic borrowed
from Compugraphic), which is covered in the section
<a href="#ALDRLD">Vertical movement</a>.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
<strong>EL</strong> does not work as advertised on the last
<a name="TERMS_OUTPUTLINE">output line</a>
of pages that contain a footer trap (e.g. one set with
<a href="#B_MARGIN">B_MARGIN</a>
or in  documents formatted using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>).
The reason is that the <strong>EL</strong> macro itself deposits
a line break that trips the trap (hey, I like that --
&quot;trips the trap&quot;), and once the trap has been sprung,
<strong>mom</strong> can't recover.  She places the line after
the <strong>EL</strong> on the next page.
<p>
If you need <strong>EL</strong> functionality on the last line of
a page with a footer trap, turn the trap off with
<a href="goodies.html#TRAP">TRAP</a>,
as in this example:
<p>
<pre>
	3.
	.TRAP OFF
	.EL
	.TRAP
	\*[FP12]Establish, once and for all, if 42 really is the answer.
</pre>

The above looks something like this upon output:
<p>
<pre>
	3.  Establish, once and for all, if 42 really is the answer.
</pre>

with &quot;3.&quot; flush at the left margin, and &quot;Establish,
once and for all...&quot; on the same line as &quot;3.&quot; but
starting 12 points in from the left margin.
<p>
If you hadn't turned the trap off for <kbd>.EL</kbd>,
&quot;3.&quot; would have appeared at the bottom of the page by
itself, with &quot;Establish, once and for all...&quot;
appearing at the top of the next page.
<br>

<!---SP--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="SPACE"><h3><u>Break lines and add space between</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>SPACE</strong> <var>&lt;space to add between lines&gt;</var>
<br>
Alias: <strong>SP</strong>

<p>
<strong>SPACE</strong> breaks a line, just like
<strong>BR</strong>, then adds space after the line.  With no
argument, it adds an extra line space.  If you pass it a numeric
argument without supplying a
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a>,
it advances that number of extra line spaces.  For example:
<p>
<pre>
	.SPACE
</pre>

breaks the line then adds an extra linespace, whereas
<p>
<pre>
	.SPACE 2
</pre>

breaks the line and adds two extra linespaces.

<p>
If you supply a unit of measure, <strong>SPACE</strong> breaks the
line then adds the specified amount of extra space to the current
linespace, as in
<p>
<pre>
	.SPACE 6p
</pre>

which breaks the line then adds six points of space to the current
linespace.

<p>
<strong>SUGGESTION: SPACE</strong> and
<a href="#ALD">ALD</a>
can be used interchangeably (<code>.SPACE&nbsp;6p</code> and
<code>.ALD&nbsp;6p</code> are equivalent).  However,
<strong>ALD</strong> without an argument does nothing, whereas
<strong>SPACE</strong> without an argument adds an extra line
space.  I recommend using <strong>SPACE</strong> when you
want an extra line space (or multiple thereof), and
<strong>ALD</strong> whenever you want some other value of space
after a line.

<p>
<strong>Experts: SPACE</strong> is an alias of <strong>sp</strong>.
You can use either, or mix 'n' match with impunity.
<br>

<!---SPREAD--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="SPREAD"><h3><u>Break and force justify (spread) lines</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>SPREAD</strong>

<p>
Sometimes, you need to break a line of

text and have it come out fully justified, not
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_QUAD">quadded</a>
left the way it would be with the <strong>BR</strong> macro.
An example of where you'd do this would be when you want to prevent a
word at the end of a line from being hyphenated (say, a proper name).

<br>

<!---JOIN--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="JOIN"><h3><u>Join input lines</u></h3></a>
<br>
Inline: <strong>\c</strong>

<p>
Sometimes, especially when in one of the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_NOFILL">nofill modes</a>,
a macro will cause a break where you don't want one.  In order
to prevent this from happening (in other words, to join
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input lines</a>
together, forming one
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_OUTPUTLINE">output line</a>),
use the groff
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>
<strong>\c</strong> at the end of each input line to
be joined to another, like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.LEFT
	.FAMILY T
	.FT R
	Some lines of text to be \c
	.FAMILY H
	.FT B
	joined \c
	.FAMILY T
	.FT R
	together.
</pre>

Upon output, the lines will be joined together to read
<p>
<pre>
	Some lines of text to be joined together.
</pre>

with the word &quot;joined&quot; in Helvetica bold.  Note the
space before <strong>\c</strong>.  Without it, the last three
words of the output line would read
<p>
<pre>
	bejoinedtogether
</pre>

Please also note that had the example been in one of the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">fill modes</a>,
there'd have been no need for the <strong>\c</strong>.

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="WS"><h3><u>Word spacing</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>WS</strong> <var>&lt;+|-wordspace&gt; | DEFAULT</var>

<p>
<strong>WS</strong> (Word Space) increases or decreases the amount
of space between words.  In
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_NOFILL">nofill modes</a>,
or if
<a href="#QUAD">QUAD</a>
is in effect, the space between words is fixed.  Therefore, if you
change the word spacing with <strong>WS</strong>, the change applies
uniformly to the space between every word on every line.  However,
when text is
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_JUST">justified</a>,
the space between words varies from line to line (in order to justify
the text).  Consequently, the change you make with <strong>WS</strong>
represents the minimum (and ideal) space groff will try to put between
words before deciding whether to hyphenate a final word or to stretch
the word spacing.

<p>
Word space is relative to type size.  Knowing how it's calculated is
unimportant. What matters is having a sense of how the value passed
to <strong>WS</strong> affects the look of your type.  Generally,
in/decreasing the word space by a value of 1 or 2 produces a difference
that in many cases is scarcely visible; in/decreasing by a value of 5
or so produces a subtle but noticeable difference; and in/decreasing
by a value greater than 10 is always apparent.  You should preview
your work to assess the effect of <strong>WS</strong>.

<p>
<a name="WS_USAGE"><strong>WS</strong></a>
takes as its argument a whole number preceded by a plus or minus sign.
Therefore, to decrease the word space slightly, you might enter
<p>
<pre>
	.WS -4
</pre>

To increase it by a noticeable amount, you might enter
<p>
<pre>
	.WS +12
</pre>

You can reset the word spacing to its previous value by switching
the plus or minus sign, like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.WS +4
	A line of text
	.WS -4
</pre>

The <code>.WS -4</code> undoes the effect of <code>.WS
+4</code>.  You can also reset <strong>WS</strong> to
its groff default by entering
<p>
<pre>
	.WS DEFAULT
</pre>

This can be particularly useful if you've been playing around
with plus and minus values, and can't remember by how much you
have to in/decrease the word space to get it back to normal.
<br>

<!---SS--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="SS"><h3><u>Sentence space</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>SS</strong> <var>&lt;+sentence space&gt; | 0 | DEFAULT</var>

<p>
<strong>SS</strong> (Sentence Space) tells groff how to treat double
spaces it encounters between sentences in
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input lines</a>.
If you use <strong>SS</strong>, input sentences with two spaces
after them AND input sentences that fall at the end of input lines
all receive a normal word space plus an additional amount of space
whose size is determined by the + value passed as an argument to
<strong>SS</strong>.  Thus,
<p>
<pre>
	.SS +2
</pre>

means that input sentences with two spaces after them receive a normal
word space PLUS the +2 value passed to <strong>SS</strong>.
<p>
Like
<strong>WS</strong>, increasing the sentence space by a value of
1 or 2 produces a difference that in many cases is scarcely visible;
increasing by a value of 5 or so produces a subtle but noticeable
difference (i.e. the space between double-spaced input sentences will
be slightly but visibly greater than the space between words); and
increasing by a value greater than 10 is always apparent.  You should
preview your work to assess the effect of <strong>SS</strong>.
<p>
There's an additional argument you can pass <strong>SS</strong>:
the number zero (without the + sign).  It's the argument you'll
use most often.  Typeset copy should never have two spaces between
sentences, and the "zero" argument tells groff to give the extra
spaces no space at all (effectively removing them).  Therefore,
if you double-space your sentences (as you should when writing in a
text editor), get in the habit of putting
<p>
<pre>
	.SS 0
</pre>

at the top of your files.

<p>
If you do use <strong>SS</strong> for something other than ensuring
that you don't get unwanted sentence spaces in output copy, you
can set or reset the sentence space to the groff default (the same
width as a word space, i.e. double-spaced input sentences will appear
double-spaced on output as well) with
<p>
<pre>
	.SS DEFAULT
</pre>

If you're using the
<a href="docprocessing.html">document processing macros</a>
and your
<a href="docprocessing.html#PRINTSTYLE">PRINTSTYLE</a>
is <strong>TYPEWRITE</strong>, <code>.SS DEFAULT</code> is the default,
because you <em>do</em> want double spaces between sentences in copy
that imitates the look of a typewritten document.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT: SS</strong> with an argument other than
&quot;0&quot; should only be used if you're of the old (and wise)
school of typists that puts two spaces between sentences.  If you
ignore this advice and use <strong>SS</strong> when you habitually
put only one space between sentences, you risk producing output where
the space between sentences is not equal.

separate sections.

<h3><u>1. HY</u></h3>

<p>
<strong>HY</strong> by itself (i.e. with no argument) simply turns
automatic hyphenation on.  Any argument other than <strong>LINES,
MARGIN, SPACE</strong> or <strong>DEFAULT</strong>, turns automatic
hyphenation off.  For example, as explained in
<a href="intro.html#MACRO_ARGS">How to read macro arguments</a>,
you could turn <strong>HY</strong> off by entering
<p>
<pre>
	.HY OFF
	   or
	.HY X
	   or
	.HY END
</pre>

<strong>HY</strong> observes the following default hyphenation rules:
<br>
<ol>
	<li>Last lines (i.e. ones that will spring a trap -- typically
	the last line on a page) will not be hyphenated.
	<li>The first and last two characters of a word are never
	split off.
</ol>

<h3><u>2. HY LINES</u></h3>

<p>
<strong>HY LINES</strong> sets the maximum number of consecutive
hyphenated lines that will appear in output copy.  2 is a very
good choice, and you'd set it with
<p>
<pre>
	.HY LINES 2
</pre>

By default, when you turn automatic hyphenation on, there is no
limit to the number of consecutive hyphenated lines.

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_DISCRETIONARYHYPHEN">Discretionary hyphens</a>
count when groff is figuring out how many lines to hyphenate;
explicit hyphens do not.

<h3><u>3. HY MARGIN</u></h3>

<p>
<strong>HY MARGIN</strong> sets the amount of room allowed at
the end of a line before hyphenation is tripped (e.g. if there's
only 6 points left at the end of a line, groff won't try to hyphenate
the next word).  <strong>HY MARGIN</strong> only applies if you're
using
<a href="#QUAD">QUAD</a>, and is really only useful if you're
using <strong>QUAD LEFT</strong>.

<p>
As an example, if you don't want groff to hyphenate words when there's
only 18 points of space left at the end of a left-quadded line,
you'd enter
<p>
<pre>
	.HY MARGIN 18p
</pre>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> The numeric argument after <strong>HY
MARGIN</strong> requires a
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a>.

<h3><u>4. HY SPACE</u></h3>

<p>
<strong>HY SPACE</strong> sets an amount of extra interword
space that groff will <em>try</em> to put between words on a
line in order to PREVENT hyphenation.  <strong>HY SPACE</strong>
applies only to
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_JUST">justified lines</a>.  Generally speaking,
you'll want this value to be quite small, since too big a value
will result in lines with gaping holes between the words.  A reasonable
value might be half a point, or one point, which you'd set with
<p>
<pre>
	.HY SPACE .5p
	    or
	.HY SPACE 1p
</pre>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> The numeric argument after <strong>HY
SPACE</strong> requires a
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a>.

<h3><u>4. HY DEFAULT</u></h3>

<p>
<strong>HY DEFAULT</strong> resets automatic hyphenation to its
default behaviour, cancelling any changes made with <strong>LINES,
MARGIN,</strong> and/or <strong>SPACE</strong>.

<h3><u>A note on hyphenation in general</u></h3>

<p>
Hyphenation is a necessary evil.  If it can be avoided, it should be.
If it can't be, it should occur infrequently.  That's the reason for
number of parameters you can set with <strong>HY</strong>.

<p>
Furthermore, hyphenation in
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_RAG">rag</a>
copy requires a great deal of attention.  At best, it should be
avoided completely by individually adjusting the number of words
on consecutive lines to achieve a pleasing, natural-looking rag.  
Since such adjustments are often too fussy for document
processing, I recommend playing around with <strong>HY MARGIN</strong>
a bit if your copy looks hyphen-heavy.
<br>

<br>
Macro: <strong>HY_SET</strong> <var>&lt;lines&gt; [ &lt;margin&gt; [ &lt;space&gt; ] ]</var>
<br>
Alias: <strong>HYSET</strong>

<p>
<strong>HY_SET</strong> lets you set the parameters for hyphenation
with a single macro.  &lt;lines&gt;, &lt;margin&gt; and &lt;space&gt;
correspond to the numeric values required by
<strong>LINES</strong>, <strong>MARGIN</strong> and
<strong>SPACE</strong> as described
<a href="#HY">above</a>.

<p>
To set just the maximum number of consecutive hyphenated lines,
you'd enter
<p>
<pre>
	.HY_SET 2
</pre>

If you wanted the same number of maximum consecutive hyphenated lines
and a hyphenation margin for use with
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_RAG">rag</a>
copy,
<p>
<pre>
	.HY_SET 2 36p
</pre>

would set the hyphenation margin to 36 points.

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="RW"><h3><u>Reduce whitespace</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>RW</strong> <var>&lt;amount of whitespace reduction between letters&gt;</var>
<br>

<p>
<strong>RW</strong> (Reduce Whitespace) and its corresponding macro,
<strong>EW</strong> (Expand Whitespace), allow you to tighten
(or loosen)
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_OUTPUTLINE">output lines</a>
by uniformly reducing or expanding the space between characters.
This is particularly useful when you want to squeeze or stretch
lines on a narrow measure.

<p>
The value passed to <strong>RW</strong> may be a whole number or a
decimal fraction.  Since a value of 1 produces a noticeable reduction
in the space between letters at text sizes, you'll most likely use
small decimal values when tightening lines.  For example,
<p>
<pre>
	.RW .1
	  or
	.RW .2
</pre>

may be just enough to squeeze an extra character or two on a
line without the change in letter spacing being obvious.  I
highly recommend previewing your work to assess the effect of
<strong>RW</strong>.

<p>
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> <strong>RW</strong> affects all
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FONT">fonts</a>
in the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FAMILY">family</a>
current at the time it's invoked.  It must be reset to zero to
cancel its effect (<code>.RW 0</code>) on those fonts, or reinvoked
(possibly with a different value) if you change family.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> By default, <strong>RW</strong> does not deposit a 
<a href="#BR">break</a>

<strong>RW</strong> to break at the ends of the previous
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input lines</a>,

<p>
<strong>EW</strong> (Expand Whitespace) expands the amount of
whitespace between letters, effectively &quot;loosening&quot; lines
of type.

<p>
The value passed to <strong>EW</strong> may be a whole number or a
decimal fraction.  Since a value of 1 produces a noticeable

It sometimes happens that a PostScript

doesn't contain all the fonts you need.  You might, for example,
be missing an italic font, or a bold font.  Or you might not be able
to get your hands on a condensed family.  That's where these macros
and inline escapes come in.  With them, you can fake the fonts
you're missing.  A word of caution, though: &quot;faked&quot;
fonts are just that -- faked.  You should only use them as a
last resort, and then only sparingly.  A word or two or a line
or two in a faked font will pass unnoticed; large patches of
type in a faked font look typographically cheap.

<br>
Macro: <strong>SETSLANT</strong> <var>&lt;degrees to slant type&gt; | RESET</var>

<p>
Pseudo-italicising of type is accomplished by slanting a roman font
a certain number of degrees to the right.  <strong>SETSLANT</strong>
lets you fix the number of degrees.  <strong>Mom</strong>'s
default is 15, which produces an acceptable approximation of an
italic font.  If you want another value -- say, 13 degrees --
you'd set it by entering
<p>
<pre>
	.SETSLANT 13
</pre>

If you change the degree of slant and later want to set it back
to the <strong>mom</strong> default, do
<p>
<pre>
	.SETSLANT RESET
</pre>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> By itself, <strong>SETSLANT</strong>
will not start pseudo-italicising type; it merely tells
<strong>mom</strong> what degree of slant you want.  To start
pseudo-italicising, use the

<p>
<strong>\*[SLANT]</strong> begins pseudo-italicising type.
<strong>\*[SLANTX]</strong> turns the feature off.  Both are
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escapes</a>,
therefore they should not appear as separate lines, but rather
be embedded in text lines, like this:

Alternatively, if you wanted the whole line pseudo-italicised,
you'd do
<p>
<pre>
	\*[SLANT]Not everything is as it seems.\*[SLANTX]
</pre>

Once <strong>\*[SLANT]</strong> is invoked, it remains in effect
until turned off.

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you're using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>
with
<a href="docprocessing.html#PRINTSTYLE">PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE</a>,
<strong>mom</strong> underlines pseudo-italics by default.  To

Macro: <strong>SETBOLDER</strong> <var>&lt;amount of emboldening, in machine units&gt; | RESET</var>

<p>
Emboldening of type is accomplished by printing characters
twice; the second printing is slightly offset from the first,
effectively &quot;thickening&quot; the character.
<strong>SETBOLDER</strong> lets you set the number of
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITS">machine units</a>

produces an acceptable approximation of a bold font.  If you want
another value -- say, 500 units -- you'd set it by entering

<p>
Pseudo-condensing of type is accomplished by reducing the width of
characters at a given point size without reducing their height,
effectively narrowing them so they look like condensed type.
<strong>CONDENSE</strong> tells <strong>mom</strong> what

80 percent of the normal character width is a good value, and
you'd set it like this:

<strong>NOTE:</strong> By itself, <strong>CONDENSE</strong>

<a href="#EL">EL</a>,
it will reverse by exactly the distance you specify.
<p>
<strong>RLD</strong> requires a unit of measure.  Decimal fractions
are allowed, and values may be combined.  Therefore, to move up
on the page by 1/4 of an inch, you could enter either
<p>
<pre>
	.RLD .25i
	    or
	.RLD 1P+6p
</pre>

As the mnemonic (<strong>R</strong>dvance
<strong>L</strong>ea<strong>D</strong>) suggests, you'll most often
use <strong>RLD</strong> with
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_PICASPOINTS">points</a>
of lead.

<a name="TABS">
	<h2><u>Tabs</u></h2>
</a>

<strong>Mom</strong> provides two different kinds of tab setup:
typesetting tabs and string tabs.  Neither one has anything to
do with the tab key on your keyboard, and both are utterly
divorced from groff's notion of tabs.  I recommend reading this
section carefully in order to understand how
<strong>mom</strong> handles tabs.

<a name="TYPESETTING_TABS"><h3><u>Typesetting tabs</u></h3></a>
<p>
Typesetting tabs are defined by both an indent from the left margin and
a line length.  This is quite different from typewriter-style tab stops
(the groff norm) that only define the left indent.  In conjunction
with the multi-column macros, typesetting tabs significantly facilitate
tabular and columnar work.
<p>
Typesetting tabs are created with the <strong>TAB_SET</strong>
macro. <strong>TAB_SET</strong> identifies the tab (by number),
establishes its left indent and line length, and optionally sets
a quad direction and fill mode.  After tabs have been created with
<strong>TAB_SET</strong>, they can be called at any time with the
<strong>TAB</strong> macro.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> see the section
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TYPESETTING">Typesetting Macros in Document Processing</a>
for information and advice on using tabs with the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>.

<a name="TYPESETTING_TABS_TUT"><h3><u>Quickie tutorial on typesetting tabs</u></h3></a>
<p>
Say you want to set up three tabs to produce an employee evaluation
that looks something like this:
<p>
<a name="TYPSETTING_TABS_SAMPLE"></a>
<pre>
	CRITERION       EVALUATION     COMMENTS

	Service           Good         Many clients specifically request
	                               support from Joe by name.

	Punctuality    Satisfactory    Tends to arrive after 8:00am, but
	                               often works through lunch hour.

	Team spirit     Needs work     Persistently gives higher priority
	                               to helping clients than respecting
	                               organizational hierarchy.
</pre>

You want the first tab (&quot;CRITERION&quot;)
<br>
<ul>
	<li>to begin at the left margin of the page (i.e. no indent)
	<li>to have a line length of 5 picas
	<li>to be set flush left
</ul>
<br>
Tabs must be numbered, and each has to be set up with a separate
<a href="#TAB_SET">TAB_SET</a>
line.  Therefore, to set up tab 1, you enter
<p>
<pre>
   .TAB_SET  1  0  5P  L
             |  |  |   |
      tab #__|  |  |   |__direction
                |  |
        indent__|  |__length
</pre>

You want the second tab (&quot;EVALUATION&quot;)
<br>
<ul>
	<li>to begin 8 picas from the left margin
	<li>to have a length of 9 picas
	<li>to be set centered.
</ul>
<br>
You set it up like this:
<p>
<pre>
   .TAB_SET  2  8P  9P  C
             |  |   |   |
      tab #__|  |   |   |__direction
                |   |
        indent__|   |__length
</pre>

You want the third tab (&quot;COMMENTS&quot;)
<br>
<ul>
	<li>to begin 19 picas from the left margin
	<li>to have a length of 17 picas
	<li>to be set flush left, <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">filled</a>
</ul>
<br>
The setup looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
   .TAB_SET  3  19P  17P  L  QUAD
             |   |    |   |    |
             |   |    |   |    |__fill output lines
             |   |    |   |
      tab #__|   |    |   |__direction
                 |    |
         indent__|    |__length
</pre>

Once the tabs are set up, you can call them in one of two ways:
<br>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#TAB">TAB</a> (with the tab
		number as an argument) breaks the current line,
		advances one linespace, and calls the tab.
	<li><a href="#TN">TN</a> (Tab Next) keeps
		you on the current line and moves over to the next
		tab in sequence (i.e. from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, etc.).
</ul>
<br>
To exit from tabs and restore your original left margin, line length,
quad direction and fill mode,  use
<a href="#TQ">TQ</a>
(Tab Quit).
<p>
Here's how the input for our sample employee evaluation looks
(with some introductory parameters):
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGE 8.5i 11i 1i 1i 1i
	.FAMILY  T
	.FT      R
	.PT_SIZE 14
	.LS      16
	.QUAD    LEFT
	.KERN
	.HY OFF
	.SS 0
	.TAB_SET 1 0   5P  L
	.TAB_SET 2 8P  9P  C
	.TAB_SET 3 19P 17P L QUAD
	.TAB 1
	CRITERION
	.TN
	EVALUATION
	.TN
	COMMENTS
	.SP
	.TAB 1
	Service
	.TN

	.TN
	Many clients specifically request support from Joe by name.
	.SP

	.SP
	.TAB 1
	Team spirit
	.TN
	Needs work
	.TN
	Persistently gives higher priority to helping clients
	than respecting organizational hierarchy.
	.TQ
</pre>

Try setting this up and previewing it with
<p>
<pre>
	groff -mom -X &lt;filename&gt;
</pre>

Notice how <kbd>.TN</kbd> simply moves over to the next tab,
while the combination <kbd>.SP/.TAB 1</kbd> breaks the
line, advances by one extra linespace, and calls the first tab.
<p>
Notice, too, how the <kbd>QUAD</kbd> argument passed to
tab 3 means you don't have to worry about the length of
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input lines</a>;
<strong>mom</strong>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">fills</a>
the tab and sets the type flush left.

<a name="STRING_TABS"><h3><u>String tabs (autotabs)</u></h3></a>
<p>
String tabs let you mark off tab positions inline.  Left indents
and line lengths are calculated from the beginning and end positions of
the marks.  This is especially useful when tab indents and lengths
need to be determined from the text that goes in each tab.
<p>
Setting up string tabs is a two-step procedure.  First, you enter an
input line in which you mark off where you want tabs to begin and end.
(This is often best done in conjunction with the
<a href="goodies.html#SILENT">SILENT</a>
macro.)
<p>
Next, you invoke the
<a href="#ST">ST</a>
macro for every string tab you defined, and optionally pass quad and
fill information to it.  That done, string tabs are called with
the
<a href="#TAB">TAB</a>
macro, just like typesetting tabs.
<p>
In combination with the
<a href="goodies.html#PAD">PAD</a>
macro and the groff inline escape
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_HORIZONTAL_GROFF">\h</a>
(move horizontally across the page) or <strong>mom</strong>'s
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_HORIZONTAL_MOM">\*[FP#]</a>
(Forward Points) inline, string tabs provide
tremendous flexibility in setting up complex tab structures.

<a name="STRING_TABS_TUT"><h3><u>Quickie tutorial on string tabs</u></h3></a>
<p>
Say you want to set up tabs for the
<a href="#TYPSETTING_TABS_SAMPLE">employee evaluation form</a>
used as an example in the
<a href="#TYPESETTING_TABS_TUT">typesetting tabs tutorial</a>.
This time, though, you want to play around with the point size of
type, so you can't know exactly how long the tabs will be or where
they should start.  All you know is
<br>
<ul>
	<li>CRITERION is the longest line in tab 1
	<li>EVALUATION is the longest line in tab 2
	<li>tab 3 should extend to the current right margin
	<li>you want a 1 pica gutter between each tab
</ul>
<br>
This is an ideal job for string tabs.
<p>
The first thing you need for string tabs is an
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input line</a>
with tab positions marked on it.  Tabs are marked with the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escapes</a>
<strong>\*[ST#]</strong> and <strong>\*[ST#X]</strong>.  (In this
example, we enclose the input line with the
<a href="goodies.html#SILENT">SILENT</a>
macro so the line doesn't print.  We also use the
<a href="goodies.html#PAD">PAD</a>
macro to permit defining tab 3 as simply &quot;the amount of
space remaining on the input line.&quot;)
<p>
The setup looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.SILENT
	.PAD "\*[ST1]CRITERION\*[ST1X]\*[FP12]\*[ST2]EVALUATION\*[ST2X]\*[FP12]\*[ST3]#\*[ST3X]"
	.SILENT OFF
</pre>

The long line after <kbd>.PAD</kbd> looks scary, but it isn't.
Here's what it means when broken down into its component parts:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>The longest line in tab 1 is &quot;CRITERION&quot;, so we
		enclose CRITERION with begin/end markers for string tab 1:
		<p>
		<kbd>\*[ST1]CRITERION\*[ST1X]</kbd>
		<br>
	<li>We want a 1 pica (12 points) gutter between tab 1 and 2,
		so we insert 12 points of space with \*[FP12]
		(<strong>F</strong>orward <strong>P</strong>oints 12):
		<p>
		<kbd>\*[FP12]</kbd>
		<br>
	<li>The longest line in tab 2 is &quot;EVALUATION&quot;, so
		we enclose EVALUATION with begin/end markers for string
		tab 2:
		<p>
		<kbd>\*[ST2]EVALUATION\*[ST2X]</kbd>
		<br>
	<li>We want 1 pica (12 points) between tab 2 and 3, so we
		insert 12 points of space with another \*[FP12]:
		<p>
		<kbd>\*[FP12]</kbd>
		<br>
	<li>We want tab 3 to be as long as whatever space remains on
		the current line length, so we enclose the
		<a href="goodies.html#PAD_MARKER">pad marker</a>
		(#) with begin/end markers for string tab 3:
		<p>
		<kbd>\*[ST3]#\*[ST3X]</kbd>
		<br>
</ul>
<br>
The tabs are now defined, but they require
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_QUAD">quad direction</a>
and
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">fill</a>
information.  For each string tab defined above, enter a
separate
<a href="#ST">ST</a>
line, like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.ST  1  L
	.ST  2  L
	.ST  3  L  QUAD
	     |  |   |
	     |  |   |__fill output lines
	     |  |
	tab__|  |__direction
	number
</pre>

From here on in, you call the tabs with
<a href="#TAB">TAB</a>
and
<a href="#TN">TN</a>
just like typesetting tabs (see
<a href="#TYPESETTING_TABS_TUT">typesetting tabs tutorial</a>).
<p>
Here's the complete setup and entry for the sample employee
evaluation form utilising string tabs.
<p>
<pre>

Try setting this up and previewing it with
<p>
<pre>
	groff -mom -X &lt;filename&gt;
</pre>

Now, change the point size of the above sample to 12 and preview
it again.  You'll see that the tab structure remains identical (tab
1=CRITERION, tab 2=EVALUATION, tab 3=space remaining, and the gutter
between tabs is still 1 pica), while the position and length 
of the tabs have altered because of the new point size.
<p>
Now try increasing the gutters to 2 picas (put an additional
<kbd>\*[FP12]</kbd> after each <kbd>\*[FP12]</kbd>).  Preview the
file again, and notice how the tab structure remains the same, but
the gutters are wider.

	<a name="TAB_SET"><h3><u>Set up typsetting tabs</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>TAB_SET</strong> <var>&lt;tab number&gt; &lt;indent&gt; &lt;length&gt;  L | R | C | J [ QUAD ]</var>
<br>
<em>*&lt;indent&gt; and &lt;length&gt; require a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>TAB_SET</strong> creates typesetting tabs that later can be
called with
<a href="#TAB">TAB</a>.
Typesetting tabs are numbered, and defined by an indent, a length,
and a &quot;direction&quot;, hence <strong>TAB_SET</strong> has
four required arguments:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>a tab number
	<li>an indent (measured from the left margin of the page,
	or, if you're already in a tab, from the left margin of the tab)
	<li>a length
	<li>a direction
</ul>
<br>
To set up a centered tab 6 picas long and 9 points from the left
margin, you'd enter
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB_SET 1 9p 6P C
</pre>

The tab number in the above (&quot;1&quot;) is simply an
identifier.  It could have been 4, or 17, or 296.  There's no
need to set up tabs in numerical sequence.
<p>
By default, tabs are in
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_NOFILL">nofill</a>
mode, meaning you can enter text in tabs on a line for line basis
without having to use the
<a href="#BR">BR</a>
macro.  If you want a tab to be
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">filled</a>,
pass the optional argument <strong>QUAD</strong>, which will
make the tab behave as if you'd entered <kbd>.QUAD L | R |
C</kbd>.
<p>
For
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_JUST">justified</a>
tabs, simply pass the argument <strong>J</strong> (without the
<strong>QUAD</strong> argument), like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB 1 9p 6P J
</pre>

Once tabs are set, they can be called at any time with the
<a href="#TAB">TAB #</a>
macro, where &quot;#&quot; is the number of the desired tab.
<p>
You can set up any number of typesetting tabs.  However, be
aware that
<a href="#STRING_TABS">string tabs</a>
are also called with <strong>TAB #</strong>, so be careful that you
don't set up a typesetting tab numbered, say, 4, when you already
have a string tab numbered 4.  Every tab, typesetting or string,
must have a unique numeric identifier.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you use <strong>TAB_SET</strong> while
you're currently inside a tab, the indent argument is the distance from
the tab's left margin, not the left margin of the page.  Therefore,
you should exit tabs (with
<a href="#TQ">TQ</a>)
before creating new tabs (unless, of course, you want to set
up a tab structure within the confines of an existing tab).
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Turn all indents off (see
<a href="#INDENTS">Indents</a>)
before setting up tabs with <strong>TAB_SET</strong>, or
<strong>mom</strong> may get confused.
<br>

<!---INLINE_ST--->

	<a name="INLINE_ST"><h3><u>Mark positions of string tabs</u></h3></a>
<br>
Inlines: <strong>\*[ST&lt;number&gt;]...\*[ST&lt;number&gt;X]</strong>

<p>
String tabs need to be marked off with
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escapes</a>
before being set up with the
<a href="#ST">ST</a>
macro.  Any input line may contain string tab markers.
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i>, above, means the numeric identifier of
the tab.  The following shows a sample input line with string
tab markers.
<p>
<pre>
	\*[ST1]Now is the time\*[ST1X] for all \*[ST2]good men\*ST2X] to come to the aid of the party.
</pre>

String tab 1 begins at the start of the line and ends after the word
&quot;time&quot;.  String tab 2 starts at &quot;good&quot; and ends
after &quot;men&quot;.  Inline escapes (e.g. font or point size
changes, or horizontal movements, including
<a href="goodies.html#PAD">padding</a>)
are taken into account when <strong>mom</strong> determines the
position and length of string tabs.
<p>
Up to nineteen string tabs may be marked (not necessarily all on
the same line, of course), and they must be numbered between 1
and 19.
<p>
Once string tabs have been marked in input lines, they have to
be &quot;set&quot; with
<a href="#ST">ST</a>,
after which they may be called, by number, with
<a href="#TAB">TAB</a>.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Lines with string tabs marked off in them
are normal input lines, i.e. they get printed, just like any
input line.  If you want to set up string tabs without the line
printing, use the
<a href="#SILENT">SILENT</a>
macro.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Do not try to set up string tabs on
a line that is broken with
<a href="#SPREAD">SPREAD</a>.
<strong>Mom</strong> calculates string tab positions and lengths
as she reads the input line, not after the line has undergone
manipulations to the word spacing.

<p>
After string tabs have been marked off on an input line (see
<a href="#INLINE_ST">\*[ST]...\*[STX]</a>),
you need to &quot;set&quot; them by giving them a direction
and, optionally, the <strong>QUAD</strong> argument.  In this
respect, <strong>ST</strong> is like
<a href="#TAB_SET">TAB_SET</a>
except that you don't have to give <strong>ST</strong> an indent
or a line length (that's already taken care of, inline, by
<kbd>\*[ST]...\*[STX]</kbd>).  If you want string tab 1 to be
left, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.ST 1 L
</pre>

If you want it to be left and
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">filled</a>, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.ST 1 L QUAD
</pre>

If you want it to be justified, enter
<p>

<a name="TAB"><h3><u>Call tabs</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>TAB</strong> <var>&lt;tab number&gt;</var>
<br>
Alias: <strong>TB</strong>
<p>
After tabs have been defined (either with
<a href="#TAB_SET">TAB_SET</a>
or
<a href="#ST">ST</a>),
<strong>TAB</strong> moves to whatever tab number you pass it as
an argument.  For example,
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB 3
</pre>

moves you to tab 3.
<p>
<a name="NOTE_TN"></a>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> <strong>TAB</strong> breaks the line preceding
it and advances 1 linespace.  Hence,
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB 1
	A line of text in tab 1.
	.TAB 2
	A line of text in tab 2.
</pre>

produces, on output
<p>
<pre>
	A line of text in tab 1.
	                           A line of text in tab 2.
</pre>

If you want the tabs to line up, use
<a href="#TN">TN</a>
(Tab Next), like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB 1
	A line of text in tab 1.
	.TN
	A line of text in tab 2.
</pre>

which produces
<p>
<pre>
	A line of text in tab 1.   A line of text in tab 2.
</pre>

If the text in your tabs runs to several lines, and you want the
first lines of each tab to align, you must use the
<a href="#MULTI_COLUMNS">multi-column</a> macros.
<p>
<strong>ADDITIONAL NOTE:</strong> Any indents in effect prior to
calling a tab are automatically turned off by <strong>TAB</strong>.
If you were happily zipping down the page with a left indent of 2
picas turned on, and you call a tab whose indent from the left margin
is 6 picas, your new distance from the left margin will be 6 picas,
not 6 picas plus the 2 pica indent.
<br>

<!---TN--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="TN"><h3><u>Tab Next</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>TN</strong>
<br>

<p>
<strong>TN</strong> moves over to the next tab in numeric
sequence (tab n+1) without advancing on the page.  See the
<a href="#NOTE_TN">NOTE</a>
in the description of the <strong>TAB</strong> macro for an
example of how <strong>TN</strong> works.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> <strong>TN</strong> is like
<a href="#EL">EL</a>
in that it doesn't work as advertised on the last line before a
footer trap is sprung.  If you need to use <strong>TN</strong>
on the last line of a page with a footer trap, turn the trap off with
<a href="goodies.html#TRAP">TRAP</a>,
as in this example:
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB_SET 1 0  1P  L
	.TAB_SET 2 1P 20P L
	.TAB 1
	.TRAP OFF
	1.
	.TN
	The first rule of survival is &quot;make and keep good friends.&quot;
	.TRAP
</pre>

The above, at the bottom of a page, will look something like this:
<p>
<pre>
	1.  The first rule of survival is &quot;make and keep good friends.&quot;
</pre>

If you hadn't turned the trap off before <kbd>.TN</kbd>,
&quot;1.&quot; would have appeared as the last line on the page,
with &quot;The first rule of survival...&quot; being the first
line on the next page.

	<h2><u>Multi-Columns</u></h2>

Tabs are not by nature columnar, which is to say that if the text
inside a tab runs to several lines, calling another tab does not
automatically move to the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_BASELINE">baseline</a>
of the first line in the previous tab.  To demonstrate:
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB 1
	Carrots
	Potatoes
	Broccoli
	.TAB 2
	$1.99/5 lbs
	$0.25/lb
	$0.99/bunch
</pre>

produces, on output
<p>
<pre>
	Carrots
	Potatoes
	Broccoli
	           $1.99/5 lbs
	           $0.25/lb
	           $0.99/bunch
</pre>

The multi-column macros allow you to set tabs in columnar
fashion, rather than line by line.  When you invoke multi-column
mode (with
<a href="#MCO">MCO</a>),
<strong>mom</strong> saves the position of the current baseline.
<a href="#MCR">MCR</a>
(Multi-column return) at any point while multi-columns are on
returns you to the saved position.  Exiting multi-columns
(<a href="#MCX">MCX</a>)
quits the current tab (if you're in one) and moves you to the
bottom of the longest column.  (Note that you do not have to use
multi-columns in conjunction with tabs.)
<p>
Using our example above, but setting it in multi-column mode,
<p>
<pre>
	.MCO
	.TAB 1
	Carrots
	Potatoes
	Broccoli
	.MCR
	.TAB 2
	$1.99/5 lbs
	$0.25/lb
	$0.99/bunch

<a name="INDENTS">
	<h2><u>Indents</u></h2>
</a>

With <strong>mom</strong>'s indents, you can indent from the left,
the right, or both margins.  In addition, <strong>mom</strong>
provides temporary left indents (i.e. only one line is indented,
as at the start of a paragraph) and &quot;hanging&quot; left indents
(the reverse of a temporary indent; the first line isn't indented,
subsequent lines are).

<a name="INDENTS_TUT"><h3><u>A brief explanation of how mom handles indents</u></h3></a>
<p>
<strong>Mom</strong> provides five kinds of indents: left, right,
both, temporary, and hanging.  Each is invoked by its own name:
<br>
<ul>
	<li><strong>IL</strong> = <strong>I</strong>ndent <strong>L</strong>eft
	<li><strong>IR</strong> = <strong>I</strong>ndent <strong>R</strong>ight
	<li><strong>IB</strong> = <strong>I</strong>ndent <strong>B</strong>oth
	<li><strong>HI</strong> = <strong>H</strong>anging <strong>I</strong>ndent
	<li><strong>TI</strong> = <strong>T</strong>emporary <strong>I</strong>ndent
</ul>
<br>
In addition, there are four macros to control exiting from
indents:
<br>
<ul>
	<li><strong>IQ</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;= quit all active indents
	<li><strong>ILX</strong>&nbsp;= exit indent style left
	<li><strong>IRX</strong>&nbsp;= exit indent style right
	<li><strong>IBX</strong>&nbsp;= exit indent style both
</ul>
<br>
This section deals exclusively with <strong>IL, IR</strong> and
<strong>IB</strong>.  For an explanation
of hanging and temporary indents -- how they work and how to use
them -- see
<a href="#HI">Hanging indents</a>
and
<a href="#TI">Temporary indents</a>.
<p>
The first time you invoke any of <strong>mom</strong>'s indents,
you must supply a measure.  For example,
<p>
<pre>
	.IL 2P
</pre>

indents text 2 picas from the left margin (or current tab
indent).
<p>
When you want to exit the above indent, use either
<p>
<pre>
	.IQ
	 or
	.ILX
</pre>

The next time you want the same indent, invoke it without the
argument, like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.IL
</pre>

As you can see, once you've supplied a measure to an indent macro
<strong>mom</strong> stores the value, obviating the need to repeat
it on subsequent invocations.  And <strong>mom</strong> doesn't just
store the measure -- she hangs on to it tenaciously.  Arguments passed
to <strong>IL, IR</strong> and <strong>IB</strong> are additive.
Consider the following:
<p>
<pre>
	.LL 20P
	.IR 2P    \"Indent right by 2 picas
	A first block of text...
	...
	...
	.IQ       \"Turn indent off
	A second block of text...
	...
	...
	.IR 2P    \"Indent right by an additional 2 picas (i.e. 4 picas)
	A third block of text...
	...
	...
</pre>

The first block of text is right indented by 2 picas (i.e. the line
length is shortened by 2 picas to 18 picas).  The second block of
text, after <strong>IQ</strong>, is, as you'd expect, set to the full
measure.  The third block of text -- the one to pay attention to --
is not right indented by 2 picas, but rather by 4 picas.
<strong>Mom</strong> adds the value of arguments to <strong>IL,
IR</strong> and <strong>IB</strong> to whatever value is already
in effect. 
<p>
If you wanted the third block of text in the example above to
be right indented by just 2 picas (the original measure given to
<strong>IR</strong>), you would enter <kbd>.IR</kbd> without an
argument.
<p>
Because indent arguments are additive, putting a minus sign in front
of the argument can be used to subtract from the current value.
In the following example, the first line is indented 18 points, the
second is indented 36 points (18+18), and the third is again indented
18 points (36-18).
<p>
<pre>
	.IL 18p     \"Indent left by 18 points      = 18 points
	Now is the time
	.IL 18p     \"Indent left by 18 points more = 36 points
	for all good men to come
	.IL -18p    \"Indent left by 18 points less = 18 points
	to the aid of the party.
</pre>

Sometimes, you may want to clear out the stored indent values -- let
<strong>mom</strong> start indenting with a clean slate, as it were.
Giving the optional argument <kbd>CLEAR</kbd> to any of the
&quot;indent quit&quot; macros resets them to zero.
<br>
<ul>
	<li><strong>IQ CLEAR</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;= quit and clear all indents
	<li><strong>ILX CLEAR</strong>&nbsp;= quit and clear indent style left
	<li><strong>IRX CLEAR</strong>&nbsp;= quit and clear indent style right
	<li><strong>IBX CLEAR</strong>&nbsp;= quit and clear indent style both
</ul>
<br>
Indent styles may be combined and manipulated separately.  You could,
for example, have a left indent of 4 picas and a right indent of 6
picas and control each separately, as in the following example.
<p>
<pre>
	.IL 4P     \"Indent left 4 picas
	.IR 6P     \"Indent right 6 picas
	Some text
	.IRX       \"Turn off the right indent only
	More text  \"Text is still indented 4 picas left
</pre>

If, at <kbd>.IRX</kbd>, you wanted the text afterward to have no
indents (either left or right), you would enter <kbd>.IQ</kbd>,
which exits all indent styles at once.
<p>
<strong>A word of advice:</strong> Indents are best used only when
you have a compelling reason not to change the current left margin or
line length.  In many instances where indents might seem expedient,
it's better to use tabs, or actually change the left margin or the
line length.  <strong>Mom</strong>'s indenting macros are flexible
and powerful, but easy to get tangled up in.  Personally, I don't
use them much, except for cutarounds and multi-level lists à la html,
at which they excel.

<a name="IL"><h3><u>Indent left</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>IL</strong> <var>[ &lt;measure&gt; ]</var>
<br>
<em>*The optional argument requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>IL</strong> indents text from the left margin of the page,
or if you're in a tab, from the left edge of the tab.  Once
<strong>IL</strong> is on, the left indent is applied uniformly to
every subsequent line of text, even if you change the line length.
<p>
The first time you invoke <strong>IL</strong>, you must give it a
measure.  Subsequent invocations with a measure add to the previous
measure.  A minus sign may be prepended to the argument to subtract
from the current measure.  The
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_STRINGWIDTH_GROFF">\w</a>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>
may be used to specify a text-dependent measure, in which case
no unit of measure is required.  For example,
<p>
<pre>
	.IL \w'margarine'
</pre>

indents text by the width of the word &quot;margarine&quot;.
<p>
With no argument, <strong>IL</strong> indents by its last
active value.  See the
<a href="#INDENTS_TUT">brief explanation of how mom handles indents</a>
for more details.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Calling a tab (with
<a href="#TAB">TAB</a>)
automatically cancels any active indents.

<p>
The first time you invoke <strong>IR</strong>, you must give it a

subtract from the current indent measure.  The
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_STRINGWIDTH_GROFF">\w</a>

<br>
<em>*The optional arguments require a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>IB</strong> allows you to set or invoke a left and a right
indent at the same time.
<p>
At its first invocation, you must supply a measure for both indents;
at subsequent invocations when you wish to supply a measure, both must
be given again.  As with <strong>IL</strong> and <strong>IR</strong>,
the measures are added to the values previously passed to the macro.
Hence, if you wish to change just one of the values, you must
give an argument of zero to the other.
<p>
<strong>A word of advice:</strong> If you need to manipulate left and
right indents separately, use a combination of <strong>IL</strong>
and <strong>IR</strong> instead of <strong>IB</strong>.  You'll
save yourself a lot of grief.
<p>
A minus sign may be prepended to the arguments to subtract from their
current values.  The
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_STRINGWIDTH_GROFF">\w</a>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline esacpe</a>

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="TI"><h3><u>Temporary (left) indent</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>TI</strong> <var>[ &lt;measure&gt; ]</var>
<br>
<em>*The optional argument requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
A temporary indent is one that applies only to the first line of
text that comes after it.  It's chief use is indenting the first
line of paragraphs.  (<strong>Mom</strong>'s
<a href="docprocessing.html#PP">PP</a>
macro, for example, uses a temporary indent.)
<p>
The first time you invoke <strong>TI</strong>, you must give it
a measure.  If you want to indent the first line of a
paragraph by, say, 2
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_EM">ems</a>,
do
<p>
<pre>
	.TI 2m
</pre>

Subsequent invocations of <strong>TI</strong> do not require you
to supply a measure; <strong>mom</strong> keeps track of the
last measure you gave it.
<p>
Because temporary indents are temporary, there's no need to turn
them off.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Unlike <strong>IL, IR</strong> and
<strong>IB</strong>, measures given to <strong>TI</strong>
are NOT additive.  In the following example, the second <kbd>.TI
2P</kbd> is exactly 2 picas.
<p>
<pre>
	.TI 1P
	The beginning of a paragraph...
	.TI 2P
	The beginning of another paragraph...
</pre>

<!---HI--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="HI"><h3><u>Hanging indent</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>HI</strong> <var>[ &lt;measure&gt; ]</var>
<br>
<em>*The optional argument requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
A hanging indent looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
	The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as best I
	    could, but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed
	    revenge.  You who so well know the nature of my soul
	    will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a
	    threat, at length I would be avenged...
</pre>

The first line of text &quot;hangs&quot; outside the left
margin.
<p>
In order to use hanging indents, you must first have a left indent
active (set with either
<a href="#IL">IL</a>
or
<a href="#IB">IB</a>).
<strong>Mom</strong> will not hang text outside the left margin set with
<a href="#L_MARGIN">L_MARGIN</a>
or outside the left margin of a tab.
<p>
The first time you invoke <strong>HI</strong>, you must give it
a measure.  If you want the first line of a paragraph to hang by,
say, 1 pica, do
<p>
<pre>
	.IL 1P
	.HI 1P
</pre>

Subsequent invocations of <strong>HI</strong> do not require you
to supply a measure; <strong>mom</strong> keeps track of the
last measure you gave it.
<p>
Generally speaking, you should invoke <strong>HI</strong> immediately
prior to the line you want hung (i.e. without any intervening
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_CONTROLLINES">control lines</a>).
And because hanging indents affect only one line, there's no need to turn
them off.

<a name="NUM_LISTS"><h3><u>A recipe for numbered lists</u></h3></a>
<p>
A common use for hanging indents is setting numbered lists.
Consider the following example:
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGE 8.5i 11i 1i 1i 1i 1i
	.FAMILY  T
	.FT      R
	.PT_SIZE 12
	.LS      14
	.JUSTIFY
	.KERN
	.SS 0
	.IL \w'\0\0.'    \"Indent left by 2 figure spaces and a period
	.HI \w'\0\0.'    \"Hang first line of text back by 2 figure spaces and a period
	1.\0The most important point to be considered is whether the
	answer to the meaning of life, the universe, and everything
	really is 42.  We have no-one's word on the subject except
	Mr. Adams'.
	.HI
	2.\0If the answer to the meaning of life, the universe,
	and everything is indeed 42, what impact does this have on
	the politics of representation?  42 is, after all not a
	prime number.  Are we to infer that prime numbers don't
	deserve equal rights and equal access in the universe?
	.HI
	3.\0If 42 is deemed non-exclusionary, how do we present it
	as the answer and, at the same time, forestall debate on its
	exclusionary implications?
</pre>

First, we invoke a left indent with a measure equal to the width
of 2
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FIGURESPACE">figures spaces</a>
plus a period (using the
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_STRINGWIDTH_GROFF">\w</a>
inline escape).  At this point, the left indent is active; text
afterward would normally be indented.  However, we invoke a hanging
indent of exactly the same width, which hangs the first line (and
first line only!) to the left of the indent by the same distance
(in this case, that means &quot;out to the left margin&quot;).
Because we begin the first line with a number, a period, and a
figure space, the actual text (&quot;The most important point...&quot;)
starts at exactly the same spot as the indented lines that
follow.
<p>
Notice that subsequent invocations of <strong>HI</strong> without a
measure produce exactly the same effect.
<p>
Paste the example above into a file and preview it with <kbd>groff -mom -X
&lt;filename&gt;</kbd> to see hanging indents in action.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Unlike <strong>IL, IR</strong> and
<strong>IB</strong>, measures given to <strong>HI</strong>
are NOT additive.  Each time you pass a measure to
<strong>HI</strong>, the measure is treated literally.
<br>

<!---IX--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="IQ"><h3><u>Quitting indents</u></h3></a>

<p>
<strong>*IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Formerly, the macro for quitting all indents was</em>
<strong>.IX</strong><em>.  This usage is now deprecated, in favour
of</em> <strong>.IQ</strong><em>.</em> <strong>.IX</strong> <em>will
continue to behave as before, but</em> <strong>mom</strong> <em>will
issue a warning to stderr indicating that you should update your
documents.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consequence of this change,</em>
<strong>ILX, IRX</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>IBX</strong> <em>may
now also be invoked as</em> <strong>ILQ, IRQ</strong> <em>and</em>
<strong>IBQ</strong><em>.  Both forms are acceptable.</em>
<p>
Without an argument, the macros to quit indents merely restore your
original left margin and line length.  The measures stored in the
indent macros themselves are saved so you can call them again without
having to supply a measure.
<p>
If you pass these macros the optional argument <strong>CLEAR</strong>,
they not only restore your original left margin and line length,
but also clear any values associated with a  particular indent style.
The next time you need an indent of the same style, you have to supply
a measure again.
<p>
<strong>IQ CLEAR</strong>, as you'd suspect, quits and clears
the values for all indent styles at once.
