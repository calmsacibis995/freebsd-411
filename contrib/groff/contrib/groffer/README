The `groffer' program is the easiest way to read `groff' documents.
All input is sent to `grog' and then to `groff' such that no special
`groff' arguments must be determined.

`groffer' also has many built-in `man' functionalities to find and
read the manual pages on UNIX and similar operating systems.  It
accepts the information from an installed `man' program, but tries to
find a man path by itself if there isn't any.

So far, `groffer' is a shell script.  It should run on any POSIX or
Bourne style shell, but it runs the fastest if the `ash' shell is
installed on the system.  This shell is found out and started
automatically.  There are efforts to port part of the shell script to
C/C++ to increase the speed independent of the shell.

For reporting bugs of `groffer', groff's free mailing list
<bug-groff@gnu.org> can be used.  For a general discussion, the
<groff@gnu.org> is more useful; see the `README' file in the top
directory of the `groff' source package for more details on this
mailing list.

`groffer' is a `groff contrib' project that was written by Bernd
Warken <bwarken@mayn.de>.
