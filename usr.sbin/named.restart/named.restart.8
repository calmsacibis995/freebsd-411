.Sh NAME
.Nm @INDOT@named.restart
.Nd "stop and restart the name server"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This command runs
.Xr ndc @SYS_OPS_EXT@
which restarts the running name server with the command line options
specified in
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.Sh BUGS
Does not wait after killing the old server before starting a new one; since
the server could take some time to die and the new one will experience a
fatal error if the old one isn't gone by the time it starts, you can be left
in a situation where you have no name server at all.
