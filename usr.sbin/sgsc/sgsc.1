.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides shell level access to the ioctl
requests served by the handy scanner device driver gsc.
Please see
.Xr gsc 4
for the exact meaning of the requests.  Generally they modify
the output and behaviour of the gsc scanner device.
When
.Nm
is called with no option only the current settings are reported.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl s Bq Dv GSC_SRESSW
Set the scanner with the values of the resolution selector switch.
.It Fl q
Operate in quiet mode, i.e. do not report any of the current settings.
Normally the parameters are shown after the modifications have been
performed.
.It Fl f Ar file
Operate on a different scanner device node given by filename.
Note
that even though there may exist more than one node of scanner device
several of them will refer the same device unit.
The modifications are
performed od the unit regardless of the device node by which it is
accessed.
.It Fl r Ar resolution Bq Dv GSC_SRES
Set the resolution in dpi.
.It Fl w Ar width Bq Dv GSC_SWIDHT
Set the width of the bitmap in pixels.
.It Fl h Ar height Bq Dv GSC_SHEIGHT
Set the height of the bitmap in lines of pixels.
.It Fl b Ar len Bq Dv GSC_SBLEN

.Ar len
lines in size.
.It Fl t Ar timeout Bq Dv GSC_SBTIME
Set the timeout time for reading one dma buffer.
