.Sh NAME
.Nm wormcontrol
.Nd control the CD-R driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Ar command
.Op Ar params...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to control the behaviour of the
.Xr worm 4
driver in order to adjust various parameters of a recordable CD
.Pq CD-R .
.Pp
Unlike many other devices, CD-R's require a very strict handling order.
Prior to writing data, the speed of the drive must be selected, and
the drive can also be turned into a
.Ql dummy
mode, where every action is only performed with the laser turned off.
This way, it's possible to test whether the environment provides a
sufficiently high data flow rate in order to actually burn the CD-R,
without destroying the medium in case of a catastrophic failure.
.Pp
In order to write a new track, the drive must be told whether the new
track will become an audio or a data track.  Audio tracks are written
with a block size of 2352 bytes, while data tracks have 2048 bytes per
block.  For audio tracks, the driver does further need to know
whether the data are recorded with a preemphasis.
.Pp
Once all tracks of a session have been written, the disk must be
.Em fixated .
This writes the table of contents and leadout information to the disk.
The disk won't be usable without doing this.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ident
.It Fl f Ar device
Use
.Ar device
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/rworm0 .
.It prepdisk Ar single \&| double Op Ar dummy
Prepare the disk for recording.  This must be done before any tracks
can be prepared, and remains in effect until the session has been
fixated.  Either single speed
.Pq for audio data
or double speed
.Pq for CD-ROM data
must be selected, and optionally, the argument
.Ar dummy
can be used to tell the drive to keep the laser turned off, for testing.
.It track Ar audio \&| data Op Ar preemp
Inform the driver about the format of the next track.  Either
.Ar audio
or
.Ar data
.Pq CD-ROM
must be selected, with an optional argument
.Ar preemp
that must be specified for an audio track where data records with
preemphasis are being used.  Once this command has been successfully
specified, the track is ready for being written.
.It fixate Ar toc-type Op Ar onp
Once all tracks have been written, this closes the current session.
The argument
.Ar toc-type
is a single digit between 0 and 4, with the following meaning:
.Bl -item
.It
0     CD audio
.It
1     CD-ROM
.It
2     CD-ROM with first track in mode 1
.It
3     CD-ROM with first track in mode 2
.It
4     CDI
.El
.Pp
The optional argument
.Ar onp
stands for
.Dq open next program area ,
which means that the next session on the CD-R will be opened and can
be recorded in the future.  Otherwise, the CD-R will be closed and
remains unchangeable.
.It blank 
Blank a CD-RW disk.
.It nextwriteable
Sets the next writeable location on the drive, used when writing 
more than one track ie CD-DA (audio) disks.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Error codes for the underlying
.Xr ioctl 2
commands are printed by the
.Xr err 3
facility.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The typical sequence of burning a data CD-R looks like:
.Bd -literal
# wormcontrol prepdisk double
# wormcontrol track data
# rtprio 5 team -v 1m 5 < cdrom.image | rtprio 5 dd of=/dev/rworm0 obs=20k
# wormcontrol fixate 1
.Ed
.Pp
Note that the
.Xr dd 1
command above is mainly used in order to
.Dq slice
the data stream.  It's particularly useful when recording audio data
with their rather unusual blocksize.  Since the underlying device is a
.Em raw
device, the blocksize used in that command must be an integral multiple
of the CD-R blocksize.
.Pp
The mentioned command
.Xr team 1
is not part of the base system, but comes extremely handy in order to
pipe a constant data stream into the CD recorder.
