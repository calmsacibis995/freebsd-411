.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_update
.Nd update an installed package
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl nv
.Op Fl r Ar oldpkg
.Ar newpkg.tgz
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to update an already installed package.
It takes care
of propagating dependencies from the replaced versions to the newly
installed version.
It would normally be used to replace all currently
installed versions of a package with a more current version.
It can
also be used to revert a package to an older version by specifying the
version to be replaced with the
.Fl r
option.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n
Print the actions to be performed but don't actually do them.
.It Fl r Ar oldpkg
Replace the specified version of the package.
Normally
.Nm
will replace all installed versions of a package with the new version.
This isn't always desirable since for some packages it is expected
that multiple versions will be installed at the same time.
This option allows a specific version to be replaced.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose output.
