.Sh NAME
.Nm i4bisppp
.Nd isdn4bsd synchronous PPP over ISDN B-channel network driver
.Sh FreeBSD SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device \&"i4bisppp\&" Op count
.Sh NetBSD SYNOPSIS
none
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the IP subsystem of the operating system with the
isdn4bsd package so that a transport of IP packets over an ISDN link
is possible.
.Pp
The driver is just a glue layer between Serge Vakulenko's sppp
backend and the ISDN4BSD package.
.Pp
Beginning with i4b version 0.95 (and only for
.Fx ) ,
the sppp
subsystem was integrated into the
.Nm
driver to support more i4b/ISDN specific options. As a consequence it is no
longer necessary to add a "options sppp" to your kernel
.Xr config 8
file. For configuration of the i4bsppp driver, either the
.Xr ispppcontrol 8
utility is used or it is configured via
.Xr isdnd 1
and its associated
.Xr isdnd.rc 5
file.
.Pp
In case an IP packet for a remote side arrives in the driver and no
connection is established yet, the driver communicates with the
.Xr isdnd 8
daemon to establish a connection.
.Pp
The driver has support for interfacing to the
.Xr bpf 4
subsystem for using
.Xr tcpdump 1
with the
.Nm isp
interfaces.
.Pp
The
.Xr ispppcontrol 8
utility is used to configure all aspects of PPP required to connect to a
remote site.
.Sh LINK0 and LINK1
The
.Em link0
and
.Em link1
flags given as parameters to
.Xr ifconfig 8
have the following meaning for the
.Nm isp
devices:
.Bl -tag -width link0 -compact
.Pp
.It Li link0
wait passively for connection
.Pp
.It Li link1
auto-dial on output
.El
.Pp
The
.Em link0
and
.Em link1
flags are set to
.Em off
by default.
.Pp
See
.Xr sppp 4
for a more detailed discussion of the flags,
