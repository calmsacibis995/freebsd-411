.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to set and display soundcard mixer device levels.
It may
also be used to start and stop recording from the soundcard.  The list
of mixer devices that may be modified are:
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
vol, bass, treble, synth, pcm, speaker, mic, cd, mix,
pcm2, rec, igain, ogain, line1, line2, and line3.
.Ed
.Pp
Not all mixer devices are available.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is run without any arguments, all supported devices are displayed
along with current values.
If the
.Ar dev
argument is specified, the value for the
.Ar dev
device will be displayed.
.Pp
To modify the mixer value
.Ar dev ,
the optional left and right channel settings of
.Ar lvol Ns Op : Ns Ar rvol
may be specified.  The
.Ar lvol
and
.Ar rvol
arguments may be from 0 - 100.  Omitting
.Ar dev
and including only the channel settings will change the main volume level.
.Pp
If the
.Fl s
flag is used, the current mixer values will be displayed in a format suitable
for use as the command-line arguments to a future invocation of
.Nm
(as above).
.Pp
To change the recording device you use one of:
.Bl -tag -width =rec -offset indent
.It Cm ^rec
toggles
.Ar rdev
of possible recording devices
.It Cm +rec
adds
.Ar rdev
to possible recording devices
.It Cm -rec
removes
.Ar rdev
from possible recording devices
.It Cm =rec
sets the recording device to
.Ar rdev
.El
.Pp
The above commands work on an internal mask.  After all the options
have been parsed, it will set then read the mask from the sound card.
This will let you see EXACTLY what the soundcard is using for the
recording device(s).
.Pp
The option recsrc will display the current recording devices.
.Pp
The option
.Fl f
.Ar device
will open
.Ar device
as the mixer device.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/mixer -compact
.It Pa /dev/mixer
the default mixer device
