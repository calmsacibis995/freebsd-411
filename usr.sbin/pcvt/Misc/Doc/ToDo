================================================================================

- implement secondary DA request: ESC [ > c and/or ESC [ > 0 c

- implement user settable primary DA response and secondary DA response

- retrying for a non-connected keyboard in doreset() must be made cpu and
  speed independent. in case of a not connected keyboard, a fast machine
  runs doreset() fast and a slow machine runs doreset() slow - bad !!

- remove single screen X server support and make PCVT_USL_VT the default
