The major contributors to pcvt are Brian and Joerg, pcvt would not be what it
is without the help, the support and the code from Joerg:

                            Brian Dunford-Shore           (brian@athe.wustl.edu)

                            wrote parts of the EGA/VGA hardware handling and
                            some of the more ugly aspects of the VT220.

                            Joerg Wunsch        (joerg_wunsch@uriah.heep.sax.de)

                            added ALL support for XFree86, the screensaver sub-
                            system and support for FreeBSD (and much more ...).


I have to thank the following people for their help, for beta-testing, bugfixes,
code, keymaps, suggestions, hints, patience and too much more to mention:

Installation / Upgrade
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  R E A D (!!!) THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE Doc/INSTALL.xxxBSD FILES CAREFULLY !
  ==========================================================================

        Again:  PLEASE  R E A D   T H E M  !!!!!             (Thank You! ;-)
        ========================================

  If you read them, you should have NO problems installing pcvt on your
  system, if you don't read them, you'll probably run into problems ...

  If you run into any difficulties, please read Doc/NotesAndHints !

NOTE 1:
-------
  It is highly recommended in order to configure the driver into the system,
  that you remove (and/or backup) your previous kernel compile directory and
  do a fresh "config" with the new pcvt configuration. This has to be done
  because the chain "config/make depend/make" obviously does not resolve ALL
  dependencies!

NOTE 2:
-------
  You MUST copy or link the Util/Makefile.inc.X for your flavour of xxx(x)BSD
  to Util/Makefile.inc . This is because FreeBSD handles manual pages
  in a differnet way than NetBSD. Also you have to edit Doc/Makefile
  to make this changes for the pcvt(4) manpage.

NOTE 3:
-------
  The driver now (from 2.10 on) DEPENDS on the BIOS video display setting 
  stored in the RTC CMOS Ram - verify your configuration setting!

NOTE 4:
-------
  If you are using the pcvt termcap entry from Etc/Termcap, please reinstall
  this into /usr/share/misc/termcap if you are upgrading, the entry had bugs
  in release 3.10 and all earlier releases.

  After doing that, you may need to generate a new termcap database for newer
  FreeBSD (2.0 and up) and NetBSD (1.0 and up) Releases: 
             cd to /usr/share/misc and execute 'cap_mkdb termcap'.

NOTE 5:
-------
  The default keyboard layout is documented in Doc/Keyboard.HP unless you
  compiled with PCVT_VT220KEY which is described in Doc/Keyboard.VT. Please
  note that PCVT_VT220KEYB is not much supported, because i don't use it.

NOTE 6:
-------
  When upgrading from a previous version of the driver, you can remove now
  the directory /usr/share/misc/vgafonts. It was moved in release 3.20 to
  /usr/share/misc/pcvtfonts.

NOTE 7:
-------
  In case you don't like pcvt's white on red kernel messages, have a look at
  the end of pcvt_conf.h, this is the place to change them.


WYSIWYG - What You Share Is What You Get
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLEASE, if you fix bugs, add features, hack this driver to work on your
hardware or simply don't get it up and running, get in contact with me!

     Help us to avoid reinventing the wheel over and over again!
     -----------------------------------------------------------

The code is far from being perfect, YOU are very welcome to enhance it !
Please mail bug reports/fixes, suggestions, enhancements & diffs to 

                        hm@hcs.de              or
                        hm@altona.hamburg.com

I will support this driver as my time permits it, feel free to contact me!

Have fun!

Hellmuth
