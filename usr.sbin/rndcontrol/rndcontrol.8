.Sh NAME
.Nm rndcontrol
.Nd a utility for manipulating the
.Pa /dev/random
device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl s Ar irq_no
.Op Fl c Ar irq_no
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to set which interrupts are used to help randomise
the
.Dq "pool of entropy"
maintained by the kernel.
The
.Pa /dev/random
and
.Pa /dev/urandom
devices are the user interface to this source of randomness.
Any changes take effect immediately.
.Pp
The following command line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl q
Turn off all output except errors.
.It Fl s Ar n
Allow IRQ
.Ar n
to be used as a source of randomness.
This option may be repeated for
more than one IRQ.
.It Fl c Ar n
Stop IRQ
.Ar n
from being used as a source of randomness.
This option may be repeated for
more than one IRQ.
.El
.Pp
The default is to have no IRQ's being used.

.Sh BUGS
Sure to be some.
