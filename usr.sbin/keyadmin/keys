# This is an example key file.

# The format of entries in this file is as follows:
# <type> <spi> <src> <dst> <transform> <key> [iv]
#
# where:
#
# <type>       is currently one of { ah | esp }
# <spi>        is a decimal number
# <src>        is an IP address for the source this association applies to
# <dst>        is an IP address for the destination this assoc. applies to
# <transform>  is currently one of { md5 } for ah, { des-cbc } for esp
# <key>        is a hexadecimal key value (key length is derived from hex len)
# [iv]         is a hexadecimal initial value (length is derived from hex len)
#                  [this field is required for des-cbc, ignored for others]
