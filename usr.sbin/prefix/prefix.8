.Dt PREFIX 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm prefix
.Nd configure network interface prefixes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Bk -words
.Ar interface prefix
.Ek
.Bk -words
.Op Cm set | delete
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to assign a prefix
to a network interface.
This command is currently just a frontend of
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
and is not recommended to be used.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr netstat 1 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr rc 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
Previously, this command was used to manipulate prefixes separately
from interface identifiers, intending to be used for prefix
renumbering.
However, it had been known that the manipulation mechanism was not
friendly with traditional address management engine in the kernel.
Thus, the KAME developers decided to invalidate the prefix
manipulation mechanism, and to clarify the entire address/prefix
manipulation in February 2001.
Since then, this command has almost been obsoleted.
All users should now use
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
IPv6 and IPsec support based on the KAME Project (http://www.kame.net/) stack
was initially integrated into
.Fx 4.0
