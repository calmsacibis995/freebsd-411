.Sh NAME
.Nm whereis
.Nd locate programs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl bms
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl BMS dir ... Fl f
.Ar program ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility checks the standard binary, manual page, and source
directories for the specified programs, printing out the paths of any
it finds.  The supplied names are first stripped of leading path name
components, any single trailing extension added by
.Xr gzip 1
or
.Xr compress 1 ,
and the leading
.Ql s.\&
or trailing
.Ql ,v
from a source code control system.
.Pp
The default path searched is the string returned by the
.Xr sysctl 8
utility for the
.Dq user.cs_path
string, with
.Pa /usr/libexec
and the current user's
.Ev $PATH
appended.  Manual pages are searched by default along the
.Ev $MANPATH .
Program sources are located in a list of known standard places,
including all the subdirectories of
.Pa /usr/src
and
.Pa /usr/ports .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl B
Specify directories to search for binaries.  Requires the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl M
Specify directories to search for manual pages.  Requires the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl S
Specify directories to search for program sources.  Requires the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl b
Search for binaries.
.It Fl f
Delimits the list of directories after the
.Fl B ,
.Fl M ,
or
.Fl S
options, and indicates the beginning of the
.Ar name
list.
.It Fl m
Search for manual pages.
.It Fl s
Search for source directories.
.It Fl u
Search for
.Dq unusual
entries.  A file is said to be unusual if it does not have one entry
of each requested type.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following finds all utilities under
.Pa /usr/bin
that do not have documentation:
.Dl whereis -m -u /usr/bin/*
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr find 1 ,
.Xr locate 1 ,
.Xr man 1 ,
.Xr which 1 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh BUGS
The search for sources is implemented as a quick search as the
first-level subdirectory of each element of the list of source
directories first.  If this didn't succeed, the utility
.Xr locate 1
is requested to do the search in deeper nested subdirectories.  This
might take some time, and will only succeed if the locate database is
up-to-date.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
This version re-implements the historical
functionality that was lost in
.Bx 4.4 .
