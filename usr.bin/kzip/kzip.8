.Sh NAME
.Nm kzip
.Nd compresses kernels
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl l Ar loadaddr
.Ar kernel
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program compresses a kernel using
.Xr gzip 1
to reduce its disk storage requirements.
It does not reduce the memory footprint once loaded into memory.
You lose all the symbols, so usability is limited.
Its main usage is making kernels for install and fixit floppies, etc.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl v
Verbose mode, reports how much memory is being used by the kernel
after compression.  Also allows you to check to make sure your kernel
is not going past the 4MB boundary.
.It Fl l Ar loadaddr
Specify the address to load the kernel into memory at.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility returns with exit code 1 if given invalid arguments.
Exit code two means 
.Nm
was unable to read or process the kernel file.
