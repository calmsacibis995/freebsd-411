x Fix "hangup failed" in unidialer
x Genericize tty code and/or support termios
x Fixup uucplock conventions for FreeBSD (including reference in tip man pages).
Sanity check for ttys
x Rename pathnames.h
x Qualify on USR
Use select call to merge tipin / tipout

x Finish table-driven modem driver
x Move HAVE_USLEEP to pathhnames.h
x Add variable for login and logout scripts (connect with Perl???)
x redials / redial delay (see dial shell script)

Add debug log capabilities for table-driven modem driver (command mode modem I/Owith timestamps).

Use select in modem drivers.
Consolidate consh()-derived code in cmds.c
Screen-oriented command menu?
Add external file-transfer protocol implementations to command menu (rz, sz, others?)

1. Rethink protection glitches on REMOTE & PHONES
   files (setuid/setgid??).

2. Make clean fix for scripting being set in .tiprc

3.  change EOFREAD to recognize more general strings.

4.  add an option that returns an exit status based on
    whether resources for the requested operation are available.

5.  write a program to list known systems (a quick shell script
    should do it); people keep forgetting the names.

6.  change remote file descriptions so that acu attributes are
    are attached to a device so that several different devices
    can be used to get to the same system (perhaps hardwired
    and phone line).  got any ideas here?  I'm looking at something
    like dv=cua1,cul1,dn11;cua2,,df03.
