.Sh NAME
.Nm modems
.Nd modem configuration data base
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The modems known by
.Xr tip 1
and their attributes are stored in an
.Tn ASCII
file which
is structured somewhat like the
.Xr termcap 5
file.  Each line in the file provides a description for a single
.Em modem .
Fields are separated by a colon (``:'').
Lines ending in a \e character with an immediately following newline are
continued on the next line.
.Pp
The first entry is the name(s) of the modem.  If there is more
than one name for a modem, the names are separated by vertical bars.
After the name of the modem comes the fields of the description.  A
field name followed by an `=' sign indicates a string value follows.  A field
name followed by a `#' sign indicates a following numeric value.
.Pp
When
.Xr tip 1
is invoked, an entry for a remote system is looked up in the
.Pa /etc/remote
database.
If the entry includes an "ACU" type capability (abbreviated at),
.Xr tip 1
looks up the specified modem in
.Pa /etc/modems .
If a modem entry is found,
the corresponding capabilities determine how
.Xr tip 1
programs the modem when connecting to and disconnecting from the
remote system.
.Sh CAPABILITIES
Capabilities are either strings (str), numbers (num), or boolean
flags (bool).  A string capability is specified by
.Em capability Ns Ar = Ns Em value ;
for example, ``reset_command=ATZ\\r''.  A numeric capability is specified by
.Em capability Ns Ar # Ns Em value ;
for example, ``intercharacter_delay#50''.  A boolean capability is specified
by simply listing the capability.
.Bl -tag -width intercharacter_delay
.It Cm \&dial_command
(str)
AT command used to dial remote system (typically, "ATDT")
.It Cm \&echo_off_command
(str)
AT command to turn off command echo.
.It Cm \&escape_guard_time
(num)
The delay, expressed in milliseconds, used to frame return-to-command
escape sequences.
.It Cm \&escape_sequence
(str)
The return-to-command escape sequence.
.It Cm \&hangup_command
(str)
AT command used to hangup modem.
.It Cm \&hw_flow_control
(bool)
Enable hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control between computer and modem (DTE/DCE).
.It Cm \&init_string
(str)
AT command used to initialize modem before dialing.
.It Cm \&intercharacter_delay
(num)
Delay value, expressed in milliseconds, between characters when sending commands
to the modem.
.It Cm \&intercommand_delay
(num)
Minimum delay value, expressed in milliseconds, to impose between commands
issued to the modem.
.It Cm \&lock_baud
(bool)
Use a fixed bit rate between the computer and the modem (DTE / DCE). The
bit rate is specified in
.Pa /etc/remote .
.It Cm \&reset_command
(str)
AT command to reset the modem.
.It Cm \&reset_delay
(num)
The time, expressed in milliseconds, required by the modem to complete
a reset and return to a ready condition.
