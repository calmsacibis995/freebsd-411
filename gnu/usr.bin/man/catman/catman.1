.Dt CATMAN 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm catman
.Nd preformat man pages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f | Fl force
.Op Fl h | Fl help
.Op Fl L | Fl locale
.Op Fl p | Fl print
.Op Fl r | Fl remove
.Op Fl v | Fl verbose
.Op Ar directories ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION 
.Nm Catman
format man pages to ASCII.  It's like typing
.Sq man program
for all man pages in 
.Ar directories .
.Ar Directories
is a list of man directories or subdirectories separated
by spaces or colons.
Use 
.Ar /usr/share/man
if no 
.Ar directories
defined.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f , Fl force
Force overwriting old cat pages.  Normally only those pages will be formatted
which are not up to date.  This option is a waste of time, CPU and RAM.
.It Fl h , Fl help
Print options and exit.
.It Fl L , Fl locale
Sense locale environment variables for possible localized man subdirectories
and process these entries only.
.It Fl p , Fl print
Don't actually format man pages. Show what would be done.
.It Fl r , Fl remove
Remove garbage, e.\& g. catpage without manpage, uncompressed catpage but
a compressed catpage exist, filenames with non-alphanumeric
characters, uncompressed manpage but a compressed manpage exist.
.It Fl v , Fl verbose
More warnings.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl $ catman
.Pp
Format man pages in
.Ar /usr/share/man
if necessary.
.Pp
.Dl $ catman $MANPATH
.Pp
Format all your man pages if necessary.
.Pp
.Dl $ catman -f /usr/local/man/man1 /usr/local/man/manl
.Pp
Force reformatting of all man pages in
.Pa /usr/local/man/man1
and
.Pa /usr/local/man/manl .
.Pp
.Dl $ catman -p /usr/X11/man
.Pp
Show only.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/periodic/weekly/330.catman
.It Pa /etc/periodic/weekly/330.catman
Starts this program
.El
.Sh FEATURES
Very fast if all man pages already formatted.
Does not support the
.Fl w
option as some other systems do.  Use
.Xr makewhatis 1
to rebuild the
.Ql whatis
database.
.Sh BUGS
.Xr man 1
is a setuid program.  Be careful that user
.Sq man
has write permissions to the catman directories.
.Nm Catman
does not check for any
.Sq .so
in man page sources.  Use hard or symlinks
to avoid redundant formatted man pages.
