/*
 * Ok.  Following are the relocation information macros.  If your
 * system should not be able to use the default set (below), you must
 * define the following:

 *   relocation_info: This must be typedef'd (or #define'd) to the type
 * of structure that is stored in the relocation info section of your
 * a.out files.  Often this is defined in the a.out.h for your system.
 *
 *   RELOC_ADDRESS (rval): Offset into the current section of the
 * <whatever> to be relocated.  *Must be an lvalue*.
 *
 *   RELOC_EXTERN_P (rval):  Is this relocation entry based on an
 * external symbol (1), or was it fully resolved upon entering the
 * loader (0) in which case some combination of the value in memory
 * (if RELOC_MEMORY_ADD_P) and the extra (if RELOC_ADD_EXTRA) contains
 * what the value of the relocation actually was.  *Must be an lvalue*.
 *
 *   RELOC_TYPE (rval): If this entry was fully resolved upon
 * entering the loader, what type should it be relocated as?
 *
 *   RELOC_SYMBOL (rval): If this entry was not fully resolved upon
 * entering the loader, what is the index of it's symbol in the symbol
 * table?  *Must be a lvalue*.
 *
 *   RELOC_MEMORY_ADD_P (rval): This should return true if the final
 * relocation value output here should be added to memory, or if the
 * section of memory described should simply be set to the relocation
 * value.
 *
 *   RELOC_ADD_EXTRA (rval): (Optional) This macro, if defined, gives
 * an extra value to be added to the relocation value based on the
 * individual relocation entry.  *Must be an lvalue if defined*.
 *
 *   RELOC_PCREL_P (rval): True if the relocation value described is
 * pc relative.
 *
 *   RELOC_VALUE_RIGHTSHIFT (rval): Number of bits right to shift the
 * final relocation value before putting it where it belongs.
 *
 *   RELOC_TARGET_SIZE (rval): log to the base 2 of the number of
 * bytes of size this relocation entry describes; 1 byte == 0; 2 bytes
 * == 1; 4 bytes == 2, and etc.  This is somewhat redundant (we could
 * do everything in terms of the bit operators below), but having this
 * macro could end up producing better code on machines without fancy
 * bit twiddling.  Also, it's easier to understand/code big/little
 * endian distinctions with this macro.
 *
 *   RELOC_TARGET_BITPOS (rval): The starting bit position within the
 * object described in RELOC_TARGET_SIZE in which the relocation value
 * will go.
 *
 *   RELOC_TARGET_BITSIZE (rval): How many bits are to be replaced
 * with the bits of the relocation value.  It may be assumed by the
 * code that the relocation value will fit into this many bits.  This
 * may be larger than RELOC_TARGET_SIZE if such be useful.
 *
 *
 *		Things I haven't implemented
 *		----------------------------
 *
 *    Values for RELOC_TARGET_SIZE other than 0, 1, or 2.
 *
 *    Pc relative relocation for External references.

/* If a this type of symbol is encountered, its name is a warning
   message to print each time the symbol referenced by the next symbol
   table entry is referenced.

   This feature may be used to allow backwards compatibility with
   certain functions (eg. gets) but to discourage programmers from
   their use.

   So if, for example, you wanted to have ld print a warning whenever
   the function "gets" was used in their C program, you would add the
   following to the assembler file in which gets is defined:

	.stabs "Obsolete function \"gets\" referenced",30,0,0,0
	.stabs "_gets",1,0,0,0

   These .stabs do not necessarily have to be in the same file as the

/* The following type indicates the definition of a symbol as being
   an indirect reference to another symbol.  The other symbol
   appears as an undefined reference, immediately following this symbol.

   Indirection is asymmetrical.  The other symbol's value will be used
   to satisfy requests for the indirect symbol, but not vice versa.
   If the other symbol does not have a definition, libraries will
   be searched to find a definition.

   So, for example, the following two lines placed in an assembler
   input file would result in an object file which would direct gnu ld
   to resolve all references to symbol "foo" as references to symbol
   "bar".

	.stabs "_foo",11,0,0,0
	.stabs "_bar",1,0,0,0

   Note that (11 == (N_INDR | N_EXT)) and (1 == (N_UNDF | N_EXT)).  */

/* The following symbols refer to set elements.  These are expected
   only in input to the loader; they should not appear in loader
   output (unless relocatable output is requested).  To be recognized
   by the loader, the input symbols must have their N_EXT bit set.
   All the N_SET[ATDB] symbols with the same name form one set.  The
   loader collects all of these elements at load time and outputs a
   vector for each name.
   Space (an array of 32 bit words) is allocated for the set in the
   data section, and the n_value field of each set element value is
   stored into one word of the array.
   The first word of the array is the length of the set (number of
   elements).  The last word of the vector is set to zero for possible
   use by incremental loaders.  The array is ordered by the linkage
   order; the first symbols which the linker encounters will be first
   in the array.

   In C syntax this looks like:

	struct set_vector {
	  unsigned int length;
	  unsigned int vector[length];
	  unsigned int always_zero;
	};

   Before being placed into the array, each element is relocated
   according to its type.  This allows the loader to create an array
   of pointers to objects automatically.  N_SETA type symbols will not
   be relocated.

   The address of the set is made into an N_SETV symbol
   whose name is the same as the name of the set.
   This symbol acts like a N_DATA global symbol
   in that it can satisfy undefined external references.

   For the purposes of determining whether or not to load in a library
   file, set element definitions are not considered "real
   definitions"; they will not cause the loading of a library
   member.

   If relocatable output is requested, none of this processing is
   done.  The symbols are simply relocated and passed through to the
   output file.

   So, for example, the following three lines of assembler code
   (whether in one file or scattered between several different ones)
   will produce a three element vector (total length is five words;
   see above), referenced by the symbol "_xyzzy", which will have the
   addresses of the routines _init1, _init2, and _init3.

   *NOTE*: If symbolic addresses are used in the n_value field of the
   defining .stabs, those symbols must be defined in the same file as
   that containing the .stabs.

	.stabs "_xyzzy",23,0,0,_init1
	.stabs "_xyzzy",23,0,0,_init2
	.stabs "_xyzzy",23,0,0,_init3

   Note that (23 == (N_SETT | N_EXT)).  */
