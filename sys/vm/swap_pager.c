 *				New Swap System
 *				Matthew Dillon
 *
 * Radix Bitmap 'blists'.
 *
 *	- The new swapper uses the new radix bitmap code.  This should scale
 *	  to arbitrarily small or arbitrarily large swap spaces and an almost
 *	  arbitrary degree of fragmentation.
 *
 * Features:
 *
 *	- on the fly reallocation of swap during putpages.  The new system
 *	  does not try to keep previously allocated swap blocks for dirty
 *	  pages.  
 *
 *	- on the fly deallocation of swap
 *
 *	- No more garbage collection required.  Unnecessarily allocated swap
 *	  blocks only exist for dirty vm_page_t's now and these are already
 *	  cycled (in a high-load system) by the pager.  We also do on-the-fly
 *	  removal of invalidated swap blocks when a page is destroyed
 *	  or renamed.
