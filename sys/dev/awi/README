*** NetBSD current
	already merged into current source tree.

        pcmcia: update the awi driver, which now supports AMD 79c930-based 
                802.11DS cards as well as 802.11FH cards, and can operate
                in infrastructure mode, adhoc mode, and wi(4) compatible
                adhoc mode. [onoe 20000322]

*** FreeBSD-current
	make directory /sys/dev/awi and put all files there.
	move if_ieee80211.h to /sys/net
	add following lines to /sys/conf/files
		dev/awi/am79c930.c	optional awi
		dev/awi/awi.c		optional awi
		dev/awi/if_awi_pccard.c	optional awi card
	add following line to config file
		device		awi0
	config and make kernel

	add description of your card to /etc/pccard.conf
	    ex.
		card "AMD" "Am79C930"
			config 0x1 "awi0" ?
		card "Icom" "SL-200"
			config 0x1 "awi0" ?
		card "Bay Networks" "BayStack 650 Wireless LAN"
