/*
 * Callbacks in the USB code operate at splusb() (actually splbio()
 * in FreeBSD). However adding packets to the input queues has to be
 * done at splimp(). It is conceivable that this arrangement could
 * trigger a condition where the splimp() is ignored and the input
 * queues could get trampled in spite of our best effors to prevent
 * it. To work around this, we implement a special input queue for
 * USB ethernet adapter drivers. Rather than passing the frames directly
 * to ether_input(), we pass them here, then schedule a soft interrupt
 * to hand them to ether_input() later, outside of the USB interrupt
 * context.
 *
 * It's questional as to whether this code should be expanded to
 * handle other kinds of devices, or handle USB transfer callbacks
 * in general. Right now, I need USB network interfaces to work
 * properly.
