# In the line following this comment, a value of 0 on the right hand
# side will not cause firmware to be bundled.  Change this value to 1
# to bundle the firmware with the driver, which may be flashed onto
# the controller, if the firmware on the controller is older than the
# one bundled, and needs to be upgraded.  The size of the driver will
# increase significantly (to over 500kB) if this option is selected.
