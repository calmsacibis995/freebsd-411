.Sh NAME
.Nm ef
.Nd "pseudo-device driver providing support for multiple ethernet frame types"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device ef"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
pseudo-device driver clones each ethernet type device with four
additional interfaces. Each of them capable to send or receive only
one predefined frame type.
.Pp
Names for the new interfaces created by adding
.Ar fN
suffix to an existing device name. Where
.Ar N
is a device unit which can have one of the following values:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
0     interface with an Ethernet_II frame
1     interface with a Novell Ethernet_802.3 frame
2     interface with an Ethernet_802.2 frame
3     interface with an Ethernet_802.2/SNAP frame support.
.Ed
.Pp
For example, device
.Ar ed0
will be populated with four devices:
.Ar ed0f0 ,
.Ar ed0f1 ,
.Ar ed0f2
and
.Ar ed0f3 .
.Pp
After that, each device can be configured as usually:
.Dl # ifconfig ed0f1 ipx 0x105
This will configure IPX protocol with network number
.Ar 0x105
and
.Ar Ethernet_802.3
frame type.
.Pp
Please note that it is impossible to configure IPX protocol on the 'raw'
.Ar ed0
device after
.Ar if_ef.ko
driver loaded.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The
.Nm
driver can be loaded via
.Xr loader.conf 5
file:
.Dl if_ef_load="YES"
.Pp
In this case an ordinary interface configuration commands can be used
in the
.Xr rc.conf 5
file:
.Dl network_interfaces="ed2 lo0 tun0 ed2f0 ed2f1"
.Dl ifconfig_ed2f0_ipx="ipx 0x101"
.Dl ifconfig_ed2f1_ipx="ipx 0x102"
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
None.
.Sh CAVEATS
Avoid to configuring 'raw' ethernet device for IPX protocol after
.Nm
driver is loaded.
