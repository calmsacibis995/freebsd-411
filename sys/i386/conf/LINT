# CPU OPTIONS

#
# You must specify at least one CPU (the one you intend to run on);
# deleting the specification for CPUs you don't need to use may make

# I386_CPU.
#
cpu		I386_CPU
cpu		I486_CPU
cpu		I586_CPU		# aka Pentium(tm)
cpu		I686_CPU		# aka Pentium Pro(tm)

#
# Options for CPU features.
#
# CPU_ATHLON_SSE_HACK tries to enable SSE instructions when the BIOS has
# forgotten to enable them.
#
# CPU_BLUELIGHTNING_FPU_OP_CACHE enables FPU operand cache on IBM
# BlueLightning CPU.  It works only with Cyrix FPU, and this option
# should not be used with Intel FPU.
#
# CPU_BLUELIGHTNING_3X enables triple-clock mode on IBM Blue Lightning
# CPU if CPU supports it. The default is double-clock mode on
# BlueLightning CPU box.
#
# CPU_BTB_EN enables branch target buffer on Cyrix 5x86 (NOTE 1).
#
# CPU_DIRECT_MAPPED_CACHE sets L1 cache of Cyrix 486DLC CPU in direct
# mapped mode.  Default is 2-way set associative mode.
#
# CPU_CYRIX_NO_LOCK enables weak locking for the entire address space
# of Cyrix 6x86 and 6x86MX CPUs by setting the NO_LOCK bit of CCR1.
# Otherwise, the NO_LOCK bit of CCR1 is cleared.  (NOTE 3)
#
# CPU_DISABLE_5X86_LSSER disables load store serialize (i.e. enables
# reorder).  This option should not be used if you use memory mapped
# I/O device(s).
#
# CPU_ENABLE_SSE enables SSE/MMX2 instructions support.
#
# CPU_ENABLE_TCC enables Thermal Control Circuitry (TCC) found in some
# Pentium(tm) 4 and (possibly) later CPUs.  When enabled and detected,
# TCC allows to restrict power consumption by using group of hw.p4tcc.*
# sysctls.  This operates independently of SpeedStep and is useful on
# systems where other mechanisms such as apm(4) or acpi(4) don't work.
#
# CPU_FASTER_5X86_FPU enables faster FPU exception handler.
#
# CPU_I486_ON_386 enables CPU cache on i486 based CPU upgrade products
# for i386 machines.
#
# CPU_IORT defines I/O clock delay time (NOTE 1).  Default values of
# I/O clock delay time on Cyrix 5x86 and 6x86 are 0 and 7,respectively
# (no clock delay).
#
# CPU_L2_LATENCY specifed the L2 cache latency value.  This option is used
# only when CPU_PPRO2CELERON is defined and Mendocino Celeron is detected.
# The default value is 5.
#
# CPU_ELAN enables support for AMDs ElanSC520 CPU.
#
# CPU_LOOP_EN prevents flushing the prefetch buffer if the destination
# of a jump is already present in the prefetch buffer on Cyrix 5x86(NOTE
# 1).
#
# CPU_PPRO2CELERON enables L2 cache of Mendocino Celeron CPUs.  This option
# is useful when you use Socket 8 to Socket 370 converter, because most Pentium
# Pro BIOSs do not enable L2 cache of Mendocino Celeron CPUs.
#
# CPU_RSTK_EN enables return stack on Cyrix 5x86 (NOTE 1).
#
# CPU_SUSP_HLT enables suspend on HALT.  If this option is set, CPU
# enters suspend mode following execution of HALT instruction.
#
# CPU_WT_ALLOC enables write allocation on Cyrix 6x86/6x86MX and AMD
# K5/K6/K6-2 cpus.
#
# CYRIX_CACHE_WORKS enables CPU cache on Cyrix 486 CPUs with cache
# flush at hold state.
#
# CYRIX_CACHE_REALLY_WORKS enables (1) CPU cache on Cyrix 486 CPUs
# without cache flush at hold state, and (2) write-back CPU cache on
# Cyrix 6x86 whose revision < 2.7 (NOTE 2).
#
# NO_F00F_HACK disables the hack that prevents Pentiums (and ONLY
# Pentiums) from locking up when a LOCK CMPXCHG8B instruction is
# executed.  This option is only needed if I586_CPU is also defined,
# and should be included for any non-Pentium CPU that defines it.
#
# NO_MEMORY_HOLE is an optimisation for systems with AMD K6 processors
# which indicates that the 15-16MB range is *definitely* not being
# occupied by an ISA memory hole.
#
# NOTE 1: The options, CPU_BTB_EN, CPU_LOOP_EN, CPU_IORT,
# CPU_LOOP_EN and CPU_RSTK_EN should not be used because of CPU bugs.
# These options may crash your system.
#
# NOTE 2: If CYRIX_CACHE_REALLY_WORKS is not set, CPU cache is enabled
# in write-through mode when revision < 2.7.  If revision of Cyrix
# 6x86 >= 2.7, CPU cache is always enabled in write-back mode.
#
# NOTE 3: This option may cause failures for software that requires

# DEVICE_POLLING adds support for mixed interrupt-polling handling

# potential increase in response times.
# It is strongly recommended to use HZ=1000 or 2000 with DEVICE_POLLING
# to achieve smoother behaviour.
# Additionally, you can enable/disable polling at runtime with the
# sysctl variable kern.polling.enable (defaults off), and select
# the CPU fraction reserved to userland with the sysctl variable
# kern.polling.user_frac (default 50, range 0..100).
#
# Not all device drivers support this mode of operation at the time of

# SCSI DEVICES

# SCSI DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# The SCSI subsystem consists of the `base' SCSI code, a number of
# high-level SCSI device `type' drivers, and the low-level host-adapter
# device drivers.  The host adapters are listed in the ISA and PCI
# device configuration sections below.
#
# Beginning with FreeBSD 2.0.5 you can wire down your SCSI devices so
# that a given bus, target, and LUN always come on line as the same
# device unit.  In earlier versions the unit numbers were assigned
# in the order that the devices were probed on the SCSI bus.  This
# means that if you removed a disk drive, you may have had to rewrite
# your /etc/fstab file, and also that you had to be careful when adding
# a new disk as it may have been probed earlier and moved your device
# configuration around.

# This old behavior is maintained as the default behavior.  The unit
# assignment begins with the first non-wired down unit for a device
# type.  For example, if you wire a disk as "da3" then the first
# non-wired disk will be assigned da4.

# Wiring devices down to a specific controller instance requires that you
# declare the controller instance.  On other words, if you plan to wire a
# device to ahc0, you need to declare the ahc0 device as well as the ahc
# device as so:

# device ahc
# device ahc0

# The syntax for wiring down devices is:

# device	scbus0 at ahc0		# Single bus device
# device	scbus1 at ahc1 bus 0	# Single bus device
# device	scbus3 at ahc2 bus 0	# Twin bus device
# device	scbus2 at ahc2 bus 1	# Twin bus device
# device 	da0 at scbus0 target 0 unit 0
# device	da1 at scbus3 target 1
# device	da2 at scbus2 target 3
# device	sa1 at scbus1 target 6
# device	cd

# "units" (SCSI logical unit number) that are not specified are
# treated as if specified as LUN 0.

# All SCSI devices allocate as many units as are required.

# The "unknown" device (uk? in pre-2.0.5) is now part of the base SCSI
# configuration and doesn't have to be explicitly configured.

# AUTO_EOI_2 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the slave 8259A

#
# MAXMEM specifies the amount of RAM on the machine; if this is not

# RAM, so the amount of memory will initially be limited to 64MB or 16MB
# depending on the BIOS.  If the BIOS reports 64MB, a memory probe will
# then attempt to detect the installed amount of RAM.  If this probe
# fails to detect >64MB RAM you will have to use the MAXMEM option.

# for drive 1.
# e.g.:
#device		wdc0	at isa? port IO_WD1 irq 14 flags 0x00ff8004
#
# specifies that drive 0 will be allowed to probe for 32 bit transfers and
# a maximum multi-sector transfer of 4 sectors, and drive 1 will not be
# allowed to probe for 32 bit transfers, but will allow multi-sector
# transfers up to the maximum that the drive supports.
#
# If you are using a PCI controller that is not running in compatibility
# mode (for example, it is a 2nd IDE PCI interface), then use config line(s)
# such as:
#
#device		wdc2	at isa? port 0 flags 0xa0ffa0ff
#device		wd4	at wdc2 drive 0
#device		wd5	at wdc2 drive 1
#
#device		wdc3	at isa? port 0 flags 0xa0ffa0ff
#device		wd6	at wdc3 drive 0
#device		wd7	at wdc3 drive 1
#
# Note that the above config would be useful for a Promise card, when used
# on a MB that already has a PIIX controller.  Note the bogus irq and port
# entries.  These are automatically filled in by the IDE/PCI support.
#
# This driver must be commented out because it is mutually exclusive with
# the ata(4) driver.

#  	options SPIGOT_UNSECURE

# Notes on the Comtrol Rocketport driver:
#
# The exact values used for rp0 depend on how many boards you have
# in the system.  The manufacturer's sample configs are listed as:
#
#   Comtrol Rocketport ISA single card
#               device  rp0     at isa? port 0x280
#
#   If instead you have two ISA cards, one installed at 0x100 and the
#   second installed at 0x180, then you should add the following to
#   your kernel configuration file:
#
#               device  rp0     at isa? port 0x100
#               device  rp1     at isa? port 0x180
#
#   For 4 ISA cards, it might be something like this:
#
#               device  rp0     at isa? port 0x180
#               device  rp1     at isa? port 0x100

#               device  rp3     at isa? port 0x240
#
#   And for PCI cards, you only need say:
#
#               device rp

# Notes on the Digiboard driver:
#
# The following flag values have special meanings:
#	0x01 - alternate layout of pins (dgb & dgm)
#	0x02 - use the windowed PC/Xe in 64K mode (dgb only)

# Notes on the Specialix SI/XIO driver:
#  **This is NOT a Specialix supported Driver!**
#  The host card is memory, not IO mapped.
#  The Rev 1 host cards use a 64K chunk, on a 32K boundary.
#  The Rev 2 host cards use a 32K chunk, on a 32K boundary.
#  The cards can use an IRQ of 11, 12 or 15.

# Notes on the Stallion stl and stli drivers:
#  See src/i386/isa/README.stl for complete instructions.
#  This is version 2.0.0, unsupported by Stallion.
#  The stl driver has a secondary IO port hard coded at 0x280.  You need
#     to change src/i386/isa/stallion.c if you reconfigure this on the boards.
#  The "flags" and "iosiz" settings on the stli driver depend on the board:
#	EasyConnection 8/64 ISA:     flags 23         iosiz 0x1000
#	EasyConnection 8/64 EISA:    flags 24         iosiz 0x10000
#	EasyConnection 8/64 MCA:     flags 25         iosiz 0x1000
#	ONboard ISA:                 flags 4          iosiz 0x10000
#	ONboard EISA:                flags 7          iosiz 0x10000
#	ONboard MCA:                 flags 3          iosiz 0x10000
#	Brumby:                      flags 2          iosiz 0x4000
#	Stallion:                    flags 1          iosiz 0x10000
#  For the PCI cards, "device stl" will suffice.

#	figure (ROWS*COLUMN*BYTES_PER_PIXEL*FRAME+PAGE_SIZE-1)/PAGE_SIZE
#   options METEOR_DEALLOC_PAGES	remove all allocated pages on close(2)
#   options METEOR_DEALLOC_ABOVE=xxx	remove all allocated pages above the
#	specified amount. If this value is below the allocated amount no action
#	taken
#   options METEOR_SYSTEM_DEFAULT={METEOR_PAL|METEOR_NTSC|METEOR_SECAM}, used
#	for initialization of fps routine when a signal is not present.
#
# The 'bktr' device is a PCI video capture device using the Brooktree
# bt848/bt848a/bt849a/bt878/bt879 chipset. When used with a TV Tuner it forms a
# TV card, e.g. Miro PC/TV, Hauppauge WinCast/TV WinTV, VideoLogic Captivator,
# Intel Smart Video III, AverMedia, IMS Turbo, FlyVideo.
#
# options 	OVERRIDE_CARD=xxx
# options 	OVERRIDE_TUNER=xxx
# options 	OVERRIDE_MSP=1
# options 	OVERRIDE_DBX=1
# These options can be used to override the auto detection
# The current values for xxx are found in src/sys/dev/bktr/bktr_card.h
# Using sysctl(8) run-time overrides on a per-card basis can be made
#
# options 	BROOKTREE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_PAL
# or
# options 	BROOKTREE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_NTSC
# Specifies the default video capture mode.
# This is required for Dual Crystal (28&35Mhz) boards where PAL is used
# to prevent hangs during initialisation, e.g. VideoLogic Captivator PCI.
#
# options 	BKTR_USE_PLL
# This is required for PAL or SECAM boards with a 28Mhz crystal and no 35Mhz
# crystal, e.g. some new Bt878 cards.
#
# options 	BKTR_GPIO_ACCESS
# This enable IOCTLs which give user level access to the GPIO port.
#
# options 	BKTR_NO_MSP_RESET
# Prevents the MSP34xx reset. Good if you initialise the MSP in another OS first
#
# options 	BKTR_430_FX_MODE
# Switch Bt878/879 cards into Intel 430FX chipset compatibility mode.
#
# options 	BKTR_SIS_VIA_MODE
# Switch Bt878/879 cards into SIS/VIA chipset compatibility mode which is
# needed for some old SiS and VIA chipset motherboards.
# This also allows Bt878/879 chips to work on old OPTi (<1997) chipset
# motherboards and motherboards with bad or incomplete PCI 2.1 support.
# As a rough guess, old = before 1998
#
#
# The oltr driver supports the following Olicom PCI token-ring adapters
# OC-3136, OC-3137, OC-3139, OC-3140, OC-3141, OC-3540, OC-3250

# SysVR4 ABI emulation
#
# The svr4 ABI emulator can be statically compiled into the kernel or loaded as
# a KLD module.  
# The STREAMS network emulation code can also be compiled statically or as a 
# module.  If loaded as a module, it must be loaded before the svr4 module
# (the /usr/sbin/svr4 script does this for you).  If compiling statically,
# the `streams' pseudo-device must be configured into any kernel which also
# specifies COMPAT_SVR4.  It is possible to have a statically-configured 
# STREAMS device and a dynamically loadable svr4 emulator;  the /usr/sbin/svr4
# script understands that it doesn't need to load the `streams' module under
# those circumstances.
# Caveat:  At this time, `options KTRACE' is required for the svr4 emulator
# (whether static or dynamic).  
# 
options 	COMPAT_SVR4	# build emulator statically
options 	DEBUG_SVR4	# enable verbose debugging

# The 'dpt' driver provides support for DPT controllers (http://www.dpt.com/).
# These have hardware RAID-{0,1,5} support, and do multi-initiator I/O.
# The DPT controllers are commonly re-licensed under other brand-names -
# some controllers by Olivetti, Dec, HP, AT&T, SNI, AST, Alphatronic, NEC and
# Compaq are actually DPT controllers.
#
# See src/sys/dev/dpt for debugging and other subtle options.
#   DPT_MEASURE_PERFORMANCE Enables a set of (semi)invasive metrics. Various
#                           instruments are enabled.  The tools in
#                           /usr/sbin/dpt_* assume these to be enabled.
#   DPT_HANDLE_TIMEOUTS     Normally device timeouts are handled by the DPT.
#                           If you ant the driver to handle timeouts, enable
#                           this option.  If your system is very busy, this
#                           option will create more trouble than solve.
#   DPT_TIMEOUT_FACTOR      Used to compute the excessive amount of time to
#                           wait when timing out with the above option.
#  DPT_DEBUG_xxxx           These are controllable from sys/dev/dpt/dpt.h
#  DPT_LOST_IRQ             When enabled, will try, once per second, to catch
#                           any interrupt that got lost.  Seems to help in some
#                           DPT-firmware/Motherboard combinations.  Minimal
#                           cost, great benefit.
#  DPT_RESET_HBA            Make "reset" actually reset the controller
#                           instead of fudging it.  Only enable this if you
#			    are 100% certain you need it.
