RAWboot readme.

This is a dumber version of the code in biosboot.

The intended usage is:

	cat /usr/mdec/rawboot /sys/compile/FOO/kernel | fdwrite

This makes it a lot easier to make a bootable floppy, and saves space
on the floppy to boot.

Of course the name you enter for the kernel isn't used...  Then again
if you know how to make two kernels fit a floppy and have a use for
it, you don't need this bootblock.
