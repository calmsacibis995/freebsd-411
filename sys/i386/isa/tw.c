 * FreeBSD Device Driver for X-10 POWERHOUSE (tm)
 * Two-Way Power Line Interface, Model #TW523
 *
 * written by Eugene W. Stark (stark@cs.sunysb.edu)
 * December 2, 1992
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * The TW523 is a carrier-current modem for home control/automation purposes.
 * It is made by:
 *
 * 	X-10 Inc.
 * 	185A LeGrand Ave.
 * 	Northvale, NJ 07647
 * 	USA
 * 	(201) 784-9700 or 1-800-526-0027
 *
 * 	X-10 Home Controls Inc.
 * 	1200 Aerowood Drive, Unit 20
 * 	Mississauga, Ontario
 *	(416) 624-4446 or 1-800-387-3346
 *
 * The TW523 is designed for communications using the X-10 protocol,
 * which is compatible with a number of home control systems, including
 * Radio Shack "Plug 'n Power(tm)" and Stanley "Lightmaker(tm)."
 * I bought my TW523 from:
 *
 *	Home Control Concepts
 *	9353-C Activity Road
 *	San Diego, CA 92126
 *	(619) 693-8887
 *
 * They supplied me with the TW523 (which has an RJ-11 four-wire modular
 * telephone connector), a modular cable, an RJ-11 to DB-25 connector with
 * internal wiring, documentation from X-10 on the TW523 (very good),
 * an instruction manual by Home Control Concepts (not very informative),
 * and a floppy disk containing binary object code of some demonstration/test
 * programs and of a C function library suitable for controlling the TW523
 * by an IBM PC under MS-DOS (not useful to me other than to verify that
 * the unit worked).  I suggest saving money and buying the bare TW523
 * rather than the TW523 development kit (what I bought), because if you
 * are running FreeBSD you don't really care about the DOS binaries.
 *
 * The interface to the TW-523 consists of four wires on the RJ-11 connector,
 * which are jumpered to somewhat more wires on the DB-25 connector, which
 * in turn is intended to plug into the PC parallel printer port.  I dismantled
 * the DB-25 connector to find out what they had done:
 *
 *	Signal		RJ-11 pin	DB-25 pin(s)	Parallel Port
 *	Transmit TX	  4 (Y)		2, 4, 6, 8	Data out
 *	Receive RX	  3 (G)		10, 14		-ACK, -AutoFeed
 *	Common		  2 (R)		25		Common
 *	Zero crossing	  1 (B)		17 or 12	-Select or +PaperEnd
 *
 * NOTE: In the original cable I have (which I am still using, May, 1997)
 * the Zero crossing signal goes to pin 17 (-Select) on the parallel port.
 * In retrospect, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense, given that the
 * -Select signal propagates the other direction.  Indeed, some people have
 * reported problems with this, and have had success using pin 12 (+PaperEnd)
 * instead.  This driver searches for the zero crossing signal on either
 * pin 17 or pin 12, so it should work with either cable configuration.
 * My suggestion would be to start by making the cable so that the zero
 * crossing signal goes to pin 12 on the parallel port.
 *
 * The zero crossing signal is used to synchronize transmission to the
 * zero crossings of the AC line, as detailed in the X-10 documentation.
 * It would be nice if one could generate interrupts with this signal,
 * however one needs interrupts on both the rising and falling edges,
 * and the -ACK signal to the parallel port interrupts only on the falling
 * edge, so it can't be done without additional hardware.
 *
 * In this driver, the transmit function is performed in a non-interrupt-driven
 * fashion, by polling the zero crossing signal to determine when a transition
 * has occurred.  This wastes CPU time during transmission, but it seems like
 * the best that can be done without additional hardware.  One problem with
 * the scheme is that preemption of the CPU during transmission can cause loss
 * of sync.  The driver tries to catch this, by noticing that a long delay
 * loop has somehow become foreshortened, and the transmission is aborted with
 * an error return.  It is up to the user level software to handle this
 * situation (most likely by retrying the transmission).

/*
 * Transmission is done by calling write() to send three byte packets of data.
 * The first byte contains a four bit house code (0=A to 15=P).
 * The second byte contains five bit unit/key code (0=unit 1 to 15=unit 16,
 * 16=All Units Off to 31 = Status Request).  The third byte specifies
 * the number of times the packet is to be transmitted without any
 * gaps between successive transmissions.  Normally this is 2, as per
 * the X-10 documentation, but sometimes (e.g. for bright and dim codes)
 * it can be another value.  Each call to write can specify an arbitrary
 * number of data bytes.  An incomplete packet is buffered until a subsequent
 * call to write() provides data to complete it.  At most one packet will
 * actually be processed in any call to write().  Successive calls to write()
 * leave a three-cycle gap between transmissions, per the X-10 documentation.
 *
 * Reception is done using read().
 * The driver produces a series of three-character packets.
 * In each packet, the first character consists of flags,
 * the second character is a four bit house code (0-15),
 * and the third character is a five bit key/function code (0-31).
