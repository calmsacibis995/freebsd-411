/*
 * This is a simple program which demonstrates use of mmapped DMA buffer
 * of the sound driver directly from application program.
 *
 * This sample program works (currently) only with Linux, FreeBSD and BSD/OS
 * (FreeBSD and BSD/OS require OSS version 3.8-beta16 or later.
 *
 * Note! Don't use mmapped DMA buffers (direct audio) unless you have
 * very good reasons to do it. Programs using this feature will not
 * work with all soundcards. GUS (GF1) is one of them (GUS MAX works).
 *
 * This program requires version 3.5-beta7 or later of OSS
 * (3.8-beta16 or later in FreeBSD and BSD/OS).

 *
 * - PROT_READ (alone) selects the input buffer.
 * - PROT_WRITE (alone) selects the output buffer.
 * - PROT_WRITE|PROT_READ together select the output buffer. This combination
 *   is required in BSD to make the buffer accessible. With just PROT_WRITE
 *   every attempt to access the returned buffer will result in segmentation/bus
 *   error. PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE is also permitted in Linux with OSS version
 *   3.8-beta16 and later (earlier versions don't accept it).
 *
 * Non duplex devices have just one buffer. When an application wants to do both
 * input and output it's recommended that the device is closed and re-opened when
 * switching between modes. PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE can be used to open the buffer
 * for both input and output (with OSS 3.8-beta16 and later) but the result may be
