 * This is the minimum driver code required to make a spigot work.
 * Unfortunatly, I can't include a real driver since the information
 * on the spigot is under non-disclosure.  You can pick up a library
 * that will work with this driver from
 * ftp://ftp.cs.uwm.edu/pub/FreeBSD-UWM.  The library contains the
 * source that I can release as well as several object modules and
 * functions that allows one to read spigot data.  See the code for
 * spigot_grab.c that is included with the library data.
 *
 * The vendor will not allow me to release the spigot library code.
 * Please don't ask me for it.
 *
 * To use this driver you will need the spigot library.  The library is
 * available from:
 *
 *	ftp.cs.uwm.edu://pub/FreeBSD-UWM/spigot/spigot.tar.gz
 *
 * Version 1.7, December 1995.
