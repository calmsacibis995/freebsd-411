/*
 * Trap and fault vector routines.
 *
 * Most traps are 'trap gates', SDT_SYS386TGT.  A trap gate pushes state on
 * the stack that mostly looks like an interrupt, but does not disable 
 * interrupts.  A few of the traps we are use are interrupt gates, 
 * SDT_SYS386IGT, which are nearly the same thing except interrupts are
 * disabled on entry.
 *
 * The cpu will push a certain amount of state onto the kernel stack for
 * the current process.  The amount of state depends on the type of trap 
 * and whether the trap crossed rings or not.  See i386/include/frame.h.  
 * At the very least the current EFLAGS (status register, which includes 
 * the interrupt disable state prior to the trap), the code segment register,
 * and the return instruction pointer are pushed by the cpu.  The cpu 
 * will also push an 'error' code for certain traps.  We push a dummy 
 * error code for those traps where the cpu doesn't in order to maintain 
 * a consistent frame.  We also push a contrived 'trap number'.
 *
 * The cpu does not push the general registers, we must do that, and we 
 * must restore them prior to calling 'iret'.  The cpu adjusts the %cs and
 * %ss segment registers, but does not mess with %ds, %es, or %fs.  Thus we
 * must load them with appropriate values for supervisor mode operation.
 *
 * On entry to a trap or interrupt WE DO NOT OWN THE MP LOCK.  This means
 * that we must be careful in regards to accessing global variables.  We
 * save (push) the current cpl (our software interrupt disable mask), call
 * the trap function, then call _doreti to restore the cpl and deal with
 * ASTs (software interrupts).  _doreti will determine if the restoration
 * of the cpl unmasked any pending interrupts and will issue those interrupts
 * synchronously prior to doing the iret.
 *
 * At the moment we must own the MP lock to do any cpl manipulation, which
 * means we must own it prior to  calling _doreti.  The syscall case attempts
 * to avoid this by handling a reduced set of cases itself and iret'ing.
