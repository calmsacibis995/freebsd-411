 *	XXX CRUFTY SS_LOCK IMPLEMENTATION REMOVED XXX
 *
 * These versions of simple_lock block interrupts,
 * making it suitable for regions accessed by both top and bottom levels.
 * This is done by saving the current value of the cpu flags in a per-cpu
 * global, and disabling interrupts when the lock is taken.  When the
 * lock is released, interrupts might be enabled, depending upon the saved
 * cpu flags.
 * Because of this, it must ONLY be used for SHORT, deterministic paths!
 *
 * Note:
 * It would appear to be "bad behaviour" to blindly store a value in
 * ss_eflags, as this could destroy the previous contents.  But since ss_eflags
 * is a per-cpu variable, and its fatal to attempt to acquire a simplelock
 * that you already hold, we get away with it.  This needs to be cleaned
 * up someday...
