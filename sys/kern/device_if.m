# Probe to see if the device is present.  Return 0 if the device exists,
# ENXIO if it cannot be found. If some other error happens during the
# probe (such as a memory allocation failure), an appropriate error code
# should be returned. For cases where more than one driver matches a
# device, a priority value can be returned.  In this case, success codes
# are values less than or equal to zero with the highest value representing
# the best match.  Failure codes are represented by positive values and
# the regular unix error codes should be used for the purpose.

# If a driver returns a success code which is less than zero, it must
# not assume that it will be the same driver which is attached to the
# device. In particular, it must not assume that any values stored in
# the softc structure will be available for its attach method and any
# resources allocated during probe must be released and re-allocated
# if the attach method is called.  If a success code of zero is
# returned, the driver can assume that it will be the one attached.
# 
# Devices which implement busses should use this method to probe for
# the existence of devices attached to the bus and add them as
# children.  If this is combined with the use of bus_generic_attach,
# the child devices will be automatically probed and attached.
