/*
 * Polling support for [network] device drivers.
 *
 * Drivers which support this feature try to register with the
 * polling code.
 *
 * If registration is successful, the driver must disable interrupts,
 * and further I/O is performed through the handler, which is invoked
 * (at least once per clock tick) with 3 arguments: the "arg" passed at
 * register time (a struct ifnet pointer), a command, and a "count" limit.
 *
 * The command can be one of the following:
 *  POLL_ONLY: quick move of "count" packets from input/output queues.
 *  POLL_AND_CHECK_STATUS: as above, plus check status registers or do
 *	other more expensive operations. This command is issued periodically
 *	but less frequently than POLL_ONLY.
 *  POLL_DEREGISTER: deregister and return to interrupt mode.
 *
 * The first two commands are only issued if the interface is marked as
 * 'IFF_UP and IFF_RUNNING', the last one only if IFF_RUNNING is set.
 *
 * The count limit specifies how much work the handler can do during the
 * call -- typically this is the number of packets to be received, or
 * transmitted, etc. (drivers are free to interpret this number, as long
 * as the max time spent in the function grows roughly linearly with the
 * count).
 *
 * Deregistration can be requested by the driver itself (typically in the
 * *_stop() routine), or by the polling code, by invoking the handler.
 *
 * Polling can be globally enabled or disabled with the sysctl variable
 * kern.polling.enable (default is 0, disabled)
 *
 * A second variable controls the sharing of CPU between polling/kernel
 * network processing, and other activities (typically userlevel tasks):
 * kern.polling.user_frac (between 0 and 100, default 50) sets the share
 * of CPU allocated to user tasks. CPU is allocated proportionally to the
 * shares, by dynamically adjusting the "count" (poll_burst).
 *
 * Other parameters can should be left to their default values.
 * The following constraints hold
 *
 *	1 <= poll_each_burst <= poll_burst <= poll_burst_max
 *	0 <= poll_in_trap <= poll_each_burst
 *	MIN_POLL_BURST_MAX <= poll_burst_max <= MAX_POLL_BURST_MAX
